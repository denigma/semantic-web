Moreover, there is a pronounced increase in senescent associated Beta-galactosidase expression in late generation Bub1b mutant mice, indicative of increased rate of cellular senescence. Homozyogous knockout of Bub1b results in lethality, while heterozygous animals exhibit no aging phenotypes [15208629].

Sustained high-level expression of BubR1 preserves genomic integrity and reduces tumorgenesis (even in the presence of genetic alterations that strongly promote aneuplodization and cancer, such as oncogenic Ras) and extends the lifespan and delays age-related deterioriation and aneuploidy in several tissues [23242215].

BubR1 overabundance exerts its protective effect by correcting mitotic checkpoints defects [23242215].

BubR1 expression level declines with age in various tissues [15208629; 17272762; 16781018].

    :description "insulin receptor; insulin receptor [Source:MGI Symbol;Acc:MGI:96575] [Ensembl]; Receptor tyrosine kinase which mediates the pleiotropic actions of insulin. Binding of insulin leads to phosphorylation of several intracellular substrates, including, insulin receptor substrates (IRS1, 2, 3, 4), SHC, GAB1, CBL and other signaling intermediates. Each of these phosphorylated proteins serve as docking proteins for other signaling proteins that contain Src- homology-2 domains (SH2 domain) that specifically recognize different phosphotyrosines residues, including the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K and SHP2. Phosphorylation of IRSs proteins lead to the activation of two main signaling pathways: the PI3K-AKT/PKB pathway, which is responsible for most of the metabolic actions of insulin, and the Ras-MAPK pathway, which regulates expression of some genes and cooperates with the PI3K pathway to control cell growth and differentiation. Binding of the SH2 domains of PI3K to phosphotyrosines on IRS1 leads to the activation of PI3K and the generation of phosphatidylinositol-(3, 4, 5)-triphosphate (PIP3), a lipid second messenger, which activates several PIP3-dependent serine/threonine kinases, such as PDPK1 and subsequently AKT/PKB. The net effect of this pathway is to produce a translocation of the glucose transporter SLC2A4/GLUT4 from cytoplasmic vesicles to the cell membrane to facilitate glucose transport. Moreover, upon insulin stimulation, activated AKT/PKB is responsible for: anti- apoptotic effect of insulin by inducing phosphorylation of BAD; regulates the expression of gluconeogenic and lipogenic enzymes by controlling the activity of the winged helix or forkhead (FOX) class of transcription factors. Another pathway regulated by PI3K- AKT/PKB activation is mTORC1 signaling pathway which regulates cell growth and metabolism and integrates signals from insulin. AKT mediates insulin-stimulated protein synthesis by phosphorylating TSC2 thereby activating mTORC1 pathway. The Ras/RAF/MAP2K/MAPK pathway is mainly involved in mediating cell growth, survival and cellular differentiation of insulin. Phosphorylated IRS1 recruits GRB2/SOS complex, which triggers the activation of the Ras/RAF/MAP2K/MAPK pathway. In addition to binding insulin, the insulin receptor can bind insulin-like growth factors (IGFI and IGFII). When present in a hybrid receptor with IGF1R, binds IGF1 (By similarity). [UniProt]" ;

Forms two different heterodimers: MutS alpha (MSH2- MSH6 heterodimer) and MutS beta (MSH2-MSH3 heterodimer) which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. When bound, heterodimers bend the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs. MutS alpha recognizes single base mismatches and dinucleotide insertion-deletion loops (IDL) in the DNA. MutS beta recognizes larger insertion-deletion loops up to 13 nucleotides long. After mismatch binding, MutS alpha or beta forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis. ATP binding and hydrolysis play a pivotal role in mismatch repair functions. The ATPase activity associated with MutS alpha regulates binding similar to a molecular switch: mismatched DNA provokes ADP-->ATP exchange, resulting in a discernible conformational transition that converts MutS alpha into a sliding clamp capable of hydrolysis-independent diffusion along the DNA backbone. This transition is crucial for mismatch repair. MutS alpha may also play a role in DNA homologous recombination repair.

Overexpression of Tert in mice engineered to be cancer-resistant by means of ehanced expression of p53, p16 and p19ARF (Sp53/Sp16/SARF/TgTERT) decreased telomere shortening with age, delayed aging and increases mean and median longevity by 40% [19013273]. Re-activation of telomerase in a model of premature aging caused by accelerated telomere shortening (duo to telomerase deficiency) was enough to revert some age-associated phenotypes [21113150].

Mice treated with an adeno-assoicated virus vector expressing TERT at the age of one lived 24% longer on average and those treated at the age of two, by 13%. Maximum lifespan of the mice treated at 1 and 2 years was also extended by and 13% and 20%, respectively.

Thus, the therapy achieved in perhipheral blood leukocytes a prevention of telomere shortening. Treated mice had lower leves of fasting insulin, improved glucose tolerance and better homeostatic model assessment. Two years old treated mice had higher IGF1 levels. Treated mice at both ages had improved memory scores. AAV9-mTERT treatment increased cyclinD1 positive cells in various tissues. Upon AAV9-mTERT treatment levels of p16 decreased in most organs (with exception of heart).

Mice without Sirt6 have a higher risk of gastrointestinal cancers.

    :observation """Cdkn2a encodes different transcripts involved mostly in cell cycle regulation and cellular senescence [12882406], but it can also act as a tumor suppressor. Its expression level increase with age in rodents [15520862]. super-Ink4a/Arf mice carrying a transgenic copy of a large genomic segment containing an intact and complete copy of the Cdkn2a (a.k.a. Ink4a/Arf) gene are significantly protected from cancer and had no indication of accelerated aging. Cells derived from super-Ink4a/Arf mice have increased resistance to in vitro immortalization and oncogenic transformation [15520276]. Loss of Cdkn2a in mice results in tumour susceptibility [11544530]. Mice deficient in Cdkn2a have smaller age-related decline in self-renewal potential as this process is associated with increasing levels of Cdkn2a [16957738].

Increased levels of p16 are associated with aging (Krishnamurthy et al., 2006; Molofsky et al., 2006) and a bona fide marker of cellular senescence (Collado et al., 2007). p16INK4a accumulates in many tissues as a function of advancing age (Krishnamurthy et al., 2004; Nielsen et al., 1999; Zindy et al., 1997) and is an effector of senescence (Campisi, 2003; Park et al., 2004),
p16INK4a is  a potent inhibitor of proliferative kinase Cdk4 (Lowe and Sherr, 2003) which is essential for pancreatic ?-cell proliferation in adult mammals (Rane et al., 1999; Tsutsui et al., 1999). p16INK4a constrains islet proliferation and regeneration in an age-dependent manner. Expression of the p16INK4a transcript is enriched in purified islets compared with the exocrine pancreas and islet-specific expression of p16INK4a increases markedly with aging (Krishnamurthy et al., 2006).
Aging in mammals is associated with reduced regenerative capacity in tissues that contain stem cells  (Chien and Karsenty, 2005) which is probably partially caused by senescence of progenitors with age  (Campisi, 2005; Lombard et al., 2005). 
Progenitor proliferation in subventricular zone and neurogenesis in the olfactory bulb as well as multipotent progenitor frequency and self-renewal potential, all decline with ageing the mouse forebrain. The decline in progenitor frequency and function correlate with increased expression of p16INK4a (Molofsky et al., 2006).
Aging p16INK4a-deficient mice exhibit a significantly smaller decline in subventricular zone proliferation, olfactory bulb neurogenesis and the frequency and self-renewal potential of multipotent progenitors (Molofsky et al., 2006).

p16 expression in skin cells is significantly lower the the group that has a strong family history of longevity. As such a younger biological age associates with lower levels of p16INKfa positive cells [22612594].

p16 expression increases exponentially with age. Expression of p16INK4a with age does not predict cancer development. p16INK4a activation is a characteristic of all emerging cancers [http://denigma.de/url/3n].

The eNoSC complex is able to sense the energy status of cell: upon glucose starvation, elevation of NAD(+)/NADP(+) ratio activates SIRT1, leading to histone H3 deacetylation followed by dimethylation of H3 at 'Lys-9' (H3K9me2) by SUV39H1 and the formation of silent chromatin in the rDNA locus. Deacetylates 'Lys-266' of SUV39H1, leading to its activation. Inhibits skeletal muscle differentiation by deacetylating PCAF and MYOD1. Deacetylates H2A and 'Lys-26' of HIST1H1E. Deacetylates 'Lys-16' of histone H4 (in vitro). Involved in NR0B2/SHP corepression function through chromatin remodeling: Recruited to LRH1 target gene promoters by NR0B2/SHP thereby stimulating histone H3 and H4 deacetylation leading to transcriptional repression. Proposed to contribute to genomic integrity via positive regulation of telomere length; however, reports on localization to pericentromeric heterochromatin are conflicting. Proposed to play a role in constitutive heterochromatin (CH) formation and/or maintenance through regulation of the available pool of nuclear SUV39H1. Upon oxidative/metabolic stress decreases SUV39H1 degradation by inhibiting SUV39H1 polyubiquitination by MDM2. This increase in SUV39H1 levels enhances SUV39H1 turnover in CH, which in turn seems to accelerate renewal of the heterochromatin which correlates with greater genomic integrity during stress response. Deacetylates 'Lys-382' of p53/TP53 and impairs its ability to induce transcription-dependent proapoptotic program and modulate cell senescence. Deacetylates TAF1B and thereby represses rDNA transcription by the RNA polymerase I. Deacetylates MYC, promotes the association of MYC with MAX and decreases MYC stability leading to compromised transformational capability. Deacetylates FOXO3 in response to oxidative stress thereby increasing its ability to induce cell cycle arrest and resistance to oxidative stress but inhibiting FOXO3-mediated induction of apoptosis transcriptional activity; also leading to FOXO3 ubiquitination and protesomal degradation. Appears to have a similar effect on MLLT7/FOXO4 in regulation of transcriptional activity and apoptosis. Deacetylates DNMT1; thereby impairs DNMT1 methyltransferase-independent transcription repressor activity, modulates DNMT1 cell cycle regulatory function and DNMT1-mediated gene silencing. Deacetylates RELA/NF-kappa-B p65 thereby inhibiting its transactivating potential and augments apoptosis in response to TNF-alpha. Deacetylates HIF1A, FOXO1, KAT5/TIP60, RB1 and HIC1. Inhibits E2F1 transcriptional activity and apoptotic function, possibly by deacetylation. Involved in HES1- and HEY2- mediated transcriptional repression. In cooperation with MYCN seems to be involved in transcriptional repression of DUSP6/MAPK3 leading to MYCN stabilization by phosphorylation at 'Ser-62'. Deacetylates MEF2D. Required for antagonist-mediated transcription suppression of AR-dependent genes which may be linked to local deacetylation of histone H3. Represses HNF1A-mediated transcription. Required for the repression of ESRRG by CREBZF. Modulates AP-1 transcription factor activity. Deacetylates NR1H3 AND NR1H2 and deacetylation of NR1H3 at 'Lys-434' positively regulates transcription of NR1H3:RXR target genes, promotes NR1H3 proteosomal degradation and results in cholesterol efflux; a promoter clearing mechanism after reach round of transcription is proposed. Involved in lipid metabolism. Implicated in regulation of adipogenesis and fat mobilization in white adipocytes by repression of PPARG which probably involves association with NCOR1 and SMRT/NCOR2. Deacetylates ACSS2 leading to its activation, and HMGCS1. Involved in liver and muscle metabolism. Through deacteylation and activation of PPARGC1A is required to activate fatty acid oxidation in skeletel muscle under low-glucose conditions and is involved in glucose homeostasis. Involved in nuclear location and activation of FOXO1 leading to increased gluconeogenesis in liver. Involved in regulation of PPARA and fatty acid beta-oxidation in liver. Involved in positive regulation of insulin secretion in pancreatic beta cells in response to glucose; the function seems to imply transcriptional repression of UCP2. Proposed to deacetylate IRS2 thereby facilitating its insuline-induced tyrosine phosphorylation. Deacetylates SREBF1 isoform SREBP-1C thereby decreasing its stability and transactivation in lipogenic gene expression. Involved in DNA damage response by repressing genes which are involved in DNA repair, such as XPC and TP73, deacetylating XRCC6/Ku70, and faciliting recruitment of additional factors to sites of damaged DNA, such as SIRT1-deacetylated NBN can recruit ATM to initiate DNA repair and SIRT1-deacetylated XPA interacts with RPA2. Also involved in DNA repair of DNA double-strand breaks by homologous recombination and specifically single-strand annealing independently of XRCC6/Ku70 and NBN. Transcriptional suppression of XPC probably involves an E2F4:RBL2 suppressor complex and protein kinase B (AKT) signaling. Transcriptional suppression of TP73 probably involves E2F4 and PCAF. Deacetylates WRN thereby regulating its helicase and exonuclease activities and regulates WRN nuclear translocation in response to DNA damage. Deacetylates APEX1 at 'Lys-6' and 'Lys-7' and stimulates cellular AP endonuclease activity by promoting the association of APEX1 to XRCC1. Increases p53/TP53-mediated transcription-independent apoptosis by blocking nuclear translocation of cytoplasmic p53/TP53 and probably redirecting it to mitochondria. Deacetylates XRCC6/Ku70 at 'Lys-537' and 'Lys-540' causing it to sequester BAX away from mitochondria thereby inhibiting stress-induced apoptosis. Is involved in autophagy, presumably by deacetylating ATG5, ATG7 and MAP1LC3B/ATG8. Deacetylates AKT1 which leads to enhanced binding of AKT1 and PDK1 to PIP3 and promotes their activation. Proposed to play role in regulation of STK11/LBK1- dependent AMPK signaling pathways implicated in cellular senescence which seems to involve the regulation of the acetylation status of STK11/LBK1. Can deacetylate STK11/LBK1 and thereby increase its activity, cytoplasmic localization and association with STRAD; however, the relevance of such activity in normal cells is unclear. In endothelial cells is shown to inhibit STK11/LBK1 activity and to promote its degradation. Deacetylates SMAD7 at 'Lys-64' and 'Lys-70' thereby promoting its degradation. Deacetylates CIITA and augments its MHC class II transacivation and contributes to its stability. Deacteylates MECOM/EVI1. Isoform 2 is shown to deacetylate 'Lys-382' of p53/TP53, however with lower activity than isoform 1. In combination, the two isoforms exert an additive effect. Isoform 2 regulates p53/TP53 expression and cellular stress response and is in turn repressed by p53/TP53 presenting a SIRT1 isoform-dependent auto-regulatory loop. SirtT1 75 kDa fragment: catalytically inactive 75SirT1 may be involved in regulation of apoptosis. May be involved in protecting chondrocytes from apoptotic death by associating with cytochrome C and interfering with apoptosome assembly (By similarity). [UniProt]" ;
    :observation """Whole-body deletion of Sirt1 in the adulthood results in mice which are seemingly normal in every way. When mice were given low doses of resveratrol after Sirt1 was disabled, there were no discernible improvement in mitochondrial function or any parameter, while mice with normal Sirt1 function given reservatrol showed dramatic increases in energy, mitochondrial biogenesis and function, AMPK activation and increased NAD+ levels in skeletal muscle. When mice lacking Sirt1 were given low doses of reserveratrol, AMPK was unaffected. When doses were significantly increased in these mice, AMPK was activated in a SIRT1-indepent manner, but still no benefit to mitochondrial function resulted [22560220]. Sirt1 overexpression mimicks the effect on reservatrol on mitochondrial function, but failed to extend lifespan [22560220].

SIRT1 knock-out mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) have a significant greater replicative capacity in culture. p19ARF levels are significantly reduced in SIRT1 knock-out MEFs [16054100].

Sirt1-null mice do not exhibit lifespan extension upon Dietary Restriction [18335035].

Sirt1 is required for high-magnitude circadian transcription of several core clock genes. It deacetylates Per2, Arntl and histones of clock-controlled genes [18662546].

The gene therapy consists of a single injected via tail vein and achieved a transduction efficiency of 20-50%. Already 1 month after treatment, the treated mice at both age groups had longer telomeres and a decrease in the short telomeres in multiple tissues, while the controls exhibit an increase in short telomerase. In contrast to their control littermates at 3 and 8 months post-treatment the blood of most of the AAV9-treated mice at 1 year had no decrease or exhibit even a net increase in average telomere length and had also no increase or even a marked decrease in percentage of short telomeres with time. Thus, the therapy achieved in perhipheral blood leukocytes a prevention of telomere shortening. Treated mice had lower leves of fasting insulin, improved glucose tolerance and better homeostatic model assessment. Two years old treated mice had higher IGF1 levels. Treated mice at both ages had improved memory scores. AAV9-mTERT treatment increased cyclinD1 positive cells in various tissues. Upon AAV9-mTERT treatment levels of p16 decreased in most organs (with exception of heart).

Although, Snell dwarf (Pit1dw/Pit1dw) DW/J males exhibit aspects of delayed senescence, their median lifespan is by about 25% shorter, probably due to the affects of housing conditions [11718806]. Mice homozygous for loss-of-function mutations at Pit1 locus have a mean and maximum lifespan extension over 40%. Mutant dwJ/dw animals exhibit delays in age-dependent collagen cross-linking and in six age-senstive indices of immune system status. Pituitary transplantation into dwarf mice does not reverse the lifespan extension effect. Male Snell dwarf mice become obese and exhibit proportionately high leptin levels in old age [11371619]." ;

Metformin treatment significantly decreases incidence and size of mammary adenocarcinomas and increases the mean latency of the tumors [16125352].

Chronic treatment of female outbred SHR mice with metformin slightly modified food consumption but decreases the body weight after the age of 20 months, slows down the age-related switch-off of estrous function, increases mean lifespan by 37.8% mean lifespan of the last 10% survivor by 20.8%, and maximum lifespan by 2.8 month (+10.3%).

Treatment with metformin started at the age of 3 months increases mean lifespan by 14% and maximum lifespan by 1 month. Treatment started at the age of 9 months insignificantly increases lifespan by only 6%, whereas the treatment started at the age of 15 months fails to increase lifespan.
