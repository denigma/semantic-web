High-level expression of ROR-1 in breast cancer cells correlates to higher rates of relapse and metastasis in patients with breand adenocarcinoma, a type of cancer that originates in glandualr tissue. Conversely, silencing expression of ROR-1 reverses EMT and inhibits the metasist spread of breast cnacer cells in animal model. Treatment with a monoclonal antibody targeting ROR-1 can inhibit the growth and spread of highly metastatic tumors that express ROR-1.

ROR-1 is an oncogene and has some tumor initiation functions. ROR-1 also appears to allow transformed cells to invade other tissues ad to promote tumor expansion in both primary and tumor site and in distant organs.

Because ROR-1 is expressed only in cancer cells, it presents a singlular, selective target for anti-cancer therapies that would leave normal cells unaffected.""" .
