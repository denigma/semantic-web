This is Denigma SemanticWeb app where for all data bigdata triple store is used

Most of the code that deals with bigdata is inside subproject

To set up the project you need to (most of instructions are for Deiban/Ubuntu based Linux, but for Windows it will be somehow similar):
* Have scala 2.10.x, play 2.2.x and sbt 0.13 installed
    - Make sure you use JDK 1.7+ and have JAVA_HOME variable setup
    - Install Scala (  ) and sbt ( http://www.scala-sbt.org/release/docs/Getting-Started/Setup.html )
    - Download play and add PLAY_HOME to your Path
* Install Coffeescript
    - if you do not have it, install nodejs ( https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installing-Node.js-via-package-manager )
    - install coffeescript with
        $  sudo npm install -g coffee-script
* Install Sass and Compass:
    - you may need to install ruby2 and gems first ( see http://gorails.com/setup/ubuntu/13.10 )
* Install following Compass libs: semantic-ui-sass and singularitygs
* go to application conf and write a path to the database (substitute current one, where antonkulaga pc is mentioned)
