.....The present study defines muscle fiber type-specific satellite cell content in human skeletal muscle tissue over the entire lifespan. Muscle biopsies were collected in 165 subjects, from different muscles of children undergoing surgery (<18 years; n = 13) and from the vastus lateralis muscle of young adult (18-49 years; n = 50), older (50-69 years; n = 53), and senescent subjects (70-86 years; n = 49). In a subgroup of 51 aged subjects (71 ± 6 years), additional biopsies were collected after 12 weeks of supervised resistance-type exercise training. Immunohistochemistry was applied to assess skeletal muscle fiber type-specific composition, size, and satellite cell content. From birth to adulthood, muscle fiber size increased tremendously with no major changes in muscle fiber satellite cell content, and no differences between type I and II muscle fibers. In contrast to type I muscle fibers, type II muscle fiber size was substantially smaller with increasing age in adults (r = -0.56; P < 0.001). This was accompanied by an age-related reduction in type II muscle fiber satellite cell content (r = -0.57; P < 0.001). Twelve weeks of resistance-type exercise training significantly increased type II muscle fiber size and satellite cell content. We conclude that type II muscle fiber atrophy with aging is accompanied by a specific decline in type II muscle fiber satellite cell content. Resistance-type exercise training represents an effective strategy to increase satellite cell content and reverse type II muscle fiber atrophy.

    rdfs:comment """ (Sarcopenia) (Satellite Cells) One interesting and important conclusion: "use it or lose it!" Furthermore, they observed that type II fiber size decreased in age, as did satellite cell content. IMO, this may be seriously confounded by most people getting more sedentary as they get older. But if that's the case, the extent of this confound might be illustrated by the size of the effect of resistance exercise on increased satellite cell population in elderly people. So I looked into the full to see how close to "normalized" type II muscle fiber satellite cells could get with resistance training. So I looked into the full-text; forgive my "eyeballing" here, but looking at Figures 5a and 5b, it appears that there is no statistically significant difference between old (51+ yrs) and young (< 51 yrs) Type II, cross sectional area *or* satellite cell per muscle fiber,  *after the resistance training protocol*. In other words, if my "eyeballing" is accurate, and this study is representative of humans, then resistance training may go a long way in maintaining muscle fiber cross sectional area and satellite cell number. These results are relevant for our research because they suggest that sarcopenia treatments *may not reliably work* in the context of a long-term, sedentary lifestyle.""" .

    :abstract """
Elevated intracellular Ca2+ levels in the aging brain are widely thought to hyperactivate Ca2+ signaling and Ca2+-dependent enzymes, leading to neuronal death through an excitatory mechanism in Alzheimer's disease (AD). This "Ca2+ overload" hypothesis has been questioned by our theoretical analyses. To better understand the relationship between the "level" and functionality of Ca2+ in aging, in this study we simultaneously measured intracellular Ca2+ transients and calpain activity in cultured human fibroblasts. We found that Ca2+ transitions elicited by bradykinin were indeed overstayed or elevated in levels in old cells but, remarkably, calpain activity was decreased compared to young cells. Also, treating young cells with the energy inhibitor rotenone or with H2O2 recapitulated the Ca2+ overstay and calpain inactivation found in old cells. More importantly, treating old cells with high-energy compounds such as phosphoenol pyruvate or phosphocreatine, which boosted cellular ATP content, reduced the Ca2+ overstay and re-activated calpain. Moreover, Ca2+ levels and calpain activity were dramatically raised in the dying cells killed by detergent. Finally, Ca2+ oscillations induced by low dose of bradykinin in old cells exhibited lower spike frequency, but higher overall levels. Collectively, these results suggest that (a) Ca2+ overload in old cells arises from an inefficient Ca2+ handling system compromised by age-related energy depletion and oxidative stress; and (b) despite elevated levels, the functionality of Ca2+ signaling has diminished in old cells. Thus, the study reinforces the concept that tonic promotion of bioenergetics and Ca2+ signaling function is a reasonable and new paradigm to protect the aging brain cells to prevent AD.
""" ;
    rdfs:comment """ (Type 3 Diabetes) (Alzheimer's) (AGEs) (ECM) Interesting study that followed Ca2+ and calpain as a measure of bioenergetics in fibroblasts. I tagged this with "Type 3 Diabetes" because the hypothesis for this is somewhat related to the current study. The "Type 3 Diabetes" hypothesis for AD suggests that AD may be caused by deficiencies in energy metabolism in the brain, caused primarily by impaired brain insulin signaling. However, this current study seems to focus on bioenergetics more generally (i.e. less so in insulin, specifically). I'm not sure on the relevance of the measurements of calpain (perhaps others on this list know better); I understand it's a non-lysosomal, non-specific, cysteine protease, so does it have something to do with endogenous Abeta degradation? Changing topics: I also tagged "AGEs" and "ECM" because (1) they studied this in fibroblasts, and (2) they studied calpain. Combining these two observations, I wondered if there may actually be some kind of bioenergetic impairment in human skin which may be the cause of poor turnover of proteins, and may actually be causing some of the accumulation of AGEs. I think it's remarkable that they reactivated calpain activity in old cells with metabolic substrates (e.g. PEP or PK). Thus: could the hypothesis they suggest here (i.e. impaired bioenergetics in the brain) also apply elsewhere in the body in aging (e.g. in the skin)? And if so, the next most important question is: "what is the stable, accumulating damage which causes it, and, if removed, would reverse it?"

Intramuscularly administered p62-encoding plasmid induced anti-p62 antibodies and exhibited strong antitumor activity in four models of allogeneic mouse tumors - B16 melanoma, Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC), S37 sarcoma, and Ca755 breast carcinoma. In mice challenged with Ca755 cells, p62 treatment had dual effect: inhibited tumor growth in some mice and prolonged life in those mice which developed tumor size similar to control. P62-encoding plasmid has demonstrated its potency both as a preventive and therapeutic vaccine. Importantly, p62 vaccination drastically suppressed metastasis formation: in B16 melanoma where tumor cells where injected intravenously, and in LLC and S37 sarcoma with spontaneous metastasis.

.....We previously observed that neuronal-like cells with an inherent mitochondrial impairment derived from PD patients contain a disorganized microtubule network, as well as, alpha-synuclein oligomer accumulation. In this work we provide new evidence that an agent that promotes microtubule network assembly, NAP (davunetide), improves microtubule-dependent traffic, restores the autophagic flux and potentiates autophagosome-lysosome fusion leading to autophagic vacuole clearance in Parkinson's disease cells. Moreover, NAP is capable of efficiently reducing alpha-synuclein oligomer content and its sequestration by the mitochondria. Most interestingly, NAP decreases mitochondrial ubiquitination levels, as well as, increases mitochondrial membrane potential indicating a rescue in mitochondrial function. Overall, we demonstrate that by improving microtubule-mediated traffic, we can avoid mitochondrial-induced damage and thus recover cell homeostasis. These results prove that NAP may be a promising therapeutic lead candidate for neurodegenerative diseases that involve axonal transport failure and mitochondrial impairment as hallmarks, like Parkinson's disease and related disorders.

In the immune response, hypohalous acids are generated by activated leukocytes via the release of myeloperoxidase and the formation of H2O2......In this study, we have compared the actions of HOCl and HOSCN on human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC). HOCl reacts rapidly with the cells, resulting in extensive cell death by both apoptosis and necrosis, with necrosis dominating at higher oxidant doses. In contrast, HOSCN is consumed more slowly, with cell death occurring only by apoptosis. Exposure of HCAEC to HOCl and HOSCN induces changes in mitochondrial membrane permeability, which, in the case of HOSCN, is associated with mitochondrial release of proapoptotic factors, including cytochrome c, apoptosis-inducing factor, and endonuclease G. With each oxidant, apoptosis appears to be caspase-independent, with the inactivation of caspases 3/7 observed, and pretreatment of the cells with the caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk having no effect on the extent of cell death. Loss of cellular thiols, depletion of glutathione, and the inactivation of thiol-dependent enzymes, including glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, were seen with both oxidants, though to a much greater extent with HOCl. The ability of myeloperoxidase-derived oxidants to induce endothelial cell apoptosis may contribute to the formation of unstable lesions in atherosclerosis. The results with HOSCN may be particularly significant for smokers, who have elevated plasma levels of SCN-, the precursor of this oxidant.

At 10ng/ml, IL-6 significantly repressed erythropoietin-dependent TF-1 erythroid maturation. While IL-6 did not decrease the expression of genes associated with hemoglobin synthesis, we observed impaired hemoglobin synthesis as demonstrated by decreased benzidine staining. We also observed that IL-6 down regulated expression of the gene SLC4a1 which is expressed late in erythropoiesis. Those findings suggested that IL-6-dependent inhibition of hemoglobin synthesis might occur. We investigated the impact of IL-6 on mitochondria. IL-6 decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential at all treatment doses, and significantly decreased mitochondrial mass at the highest dose. Our studies indicate that IL-6 may impair mitochondrial function in maturing erythroid cells resulting in impaired hemoglobin production and erythroid maturation.

However the chemistry they illustrate (Figure 7) is exchange of Schiffs base products with external hydrazines, whjch is a) well known and b) not really relevant to AGEs. As you say, Max, this is simply diverting the initial addition product down a different reaction pathway rather than reversing AGEs. This sort of mechanism would be very unlikely to work on CML, pentosidine, glucosepane etc..
 
A lot of the rest of their paper is dubious. They do not explain how they make their ‘glycated insulin’ (the original method is in a paper I cannot get at at all). They show reduction of AGEing of HSA in vitro by co-incubating HSA with glucose and the drug, so this is consistent with this agent blocking formation of AGE, not cleaving it. The anti-pentosidine antibody they use we know does not really detect pentosidine – goodness knows what they are detecting, but is only loosely related to AGE. The mice are dosed with hydralazine for 60 days, then they measure glycated serum albumin and glycated haemoglobin, which have turnover in rats of a few days and a week respectively (I could not find data on mice), ie again this is consistent with hydralazine blocking Schiffs base formation in high glucose environments, not breaking AGE once it has formed. So basically they have shown that hydralazine works like aminoguanidine. Interesting but not that useful for us.""" .

Studies of diverse species have revealed that chromatin undergoes extensive rearrangements during aging. Cellular senescence, an important component of mammalian aging, has recently been associated with decreased heterochromatinization of normally silenced regions of the genome.

.....We evaluated the prevalence of sarcopenia and its association with functional and clinical status in a population of healthy ambulatory subjects over 45 years living at home, in Paris (France). This study was conducted selecting all ambulatory participants (n = 1,445) aged 45 years and older from October 2008 to September 2011, consulting in the Institute of Physiology (Institut de Jaeger) from Paris (France) for a functional and muscular evaluation, and did not have limitations to moderate physical exercise. All were healthy people. All subjects performed a medical examination, associated with evaluation of muscle mass (body composition assessment using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) and of muscle function (by hand grip strength). Diagnosis of sarcopenia required the documentation of low muscle mass with low muscle strength according to the current international consensus definition of sarcopenia. From 1,421 participants (553 males and 868 females) definitively enrolled, 221 subjects (135 females and 86 males) (15.5 %) were identified as sarcopenic. Results from multivariate logistic regression models showed that sarcopenia was inversely associated with BMI with those participants with BMI higher than 22 kg/m2 showing a lower risk of sarcopenia relative to those with BMI less than 21 kg/m2 (OR 0.72; 95 % CI 0.60-0.91). Similarly, probability of sarcopenia was lower among subjects involved in leisure physical activities for 3 h or more per week (OR 0.45; 95 % CI 0.24-0.93). According to the category of age [45-54; 55-64; 65-74; 75-84 and 85 years or more], the prevalence of sarcopenia in women increase from 9.1; 12.7; 14.5; 19.4; to 33.3 %, respectively. For the men, the percentage of sarcopenia increase with aging from 8.6; 15.6; 13.6; 63.8 to 45.5 %, respectively. The present study suggests that among healthy ambulatory subjects over 45 years living at home, sarcopenia is frequent, even to the youngest subjects of the studied population, taking place from 9 % from 45 years, until 64.3 % for the subjects over 85 years. Our findings support the hypothesis that muscle mass and function are associated with BMI and physical activity, whatever the age of the subject.

Fluorescent Timer, or DsRed1-E5, is a mutant of the red fluorescent protein, dsRed, in which fluorescence shifts over time from green to red as the protein matures. This molecular clock gives temporal and spatial information on protein turnover. To visualize mitochondrial turnover, we targeted Timer to the mitochondrial matrix with a mitochondrial-targeting sequence (coined "MitoTimer") and cloned it into a tetracycline-inducible promoter construct to regulate its expression. Here we report characterization of this novel fluorescent reporter for mitochondrial dynamics. Tet-On HEK 293 cells were transfected with pTRE-tight-MitoTimer and production was induced with doxycycline (Dox). Mitochondrial distribution was demonstrated by fluorescence microscopy and verified by subcellular fractionation and western blot analysis. Dox addition for as little as 1 h was sufficient to induce MitoTimer expression within 4 h, with persistence in the mitochondrial fraction for up to 6 d. The color-specific conformation of MitoTimer was stable after fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde. Ratiometric analysis of MitoTimer revealed a time-dependent transition from green to red over 48 h and was amenable to analysis by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry of whole cells or isolated mitochondria. A second Dox administration 48 h after the initial induction resulted in a second round of expression of green MitoTimer. The extent of new protein incorporation during a second pulse was increased by administration of a mitochondrial uncoupler or simvastatin, both of which trigger mitophagy and biogenesis. MitoTimer is a novel fluorescent reporter protein that can reveal new insights into mitochondrial dynamics within cells. Coupled with organelle flow cytometry, it offers new opportunities to investigate mitochondrial subpopulations by biochemical or proteomic methods.

Located on chromosome 9p21.3, p16INK4a seems lost amongst a cluster of neighboring tumor suppressor genes. While best known for inhibiting cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) activity, p16INK4a is not a one trick pony. Long term p16INK4a expression pushes cells to enter senescence, an irreversible cell cycle arrest that prevents the growth of would-be cancer cells, but also contributes to aging. Loss of p16INK4a is one of the most frequent events in human tumors and allows pre-cancerous lesions to bypass senescence. Therefore, precise regulation of p16INK4a is essential to tissue homeostasis, maintaining a tight balance between tumor suppression and aging. Here, we outline the pathways required for proper p16INK4a regulation and highlight the critical functions of p16INK4a in cancer, aging and human physiology that make this gene special.

.....Measurement of tissue AGEs by skin autofluorescence (SAF) correlates well with cardiovascular outcomes in dialysis patients.....Methods: SAF was measured using an AGE reader in 66 patients who had received a kidney transplant. Values were compared to those obtained in 1,707 patients with CKD stage 3 and in 115 patients on dialysis. Results: Mean SAF in transplant recipients [2.81 ± 0.64 arbitrary units (AU)] was significantly lower than in patients on haemodialysis (3.73 ± 0.88 AU) and peritoneal dialysis (3.57 ± 0.75 AU; p < 0.001), but was no different from CKD stage 3 (2.79 ± 0.66 AU; p = 0.42). In the transplant group, SAF correlated most strongly with age (r = 0.316). There was no correlation between SAF and estimated glomerular filtration rate or renal replacement therapy vintage. A small cohort of patients with SAF recorded on dialysis and following transplantation showed a drop in SAF over a mean time of 16 months after transplantation. Discussion: Tissue AGE values in kidney transplant recipients are significantly lower than in patients receiving dialysis and similar to those in patients with CKD stage 3. Our data suggest that transplantation may be associated with a reduction in tissue AGEs, and this might be an important component of the observed reduction in cardiovascular risk in transplant recipients compared to patients on dialysis.

Following extensive quality control, we adaptively combined methylation measures for neighboring, highly-correlated CpGs into 4 344 016 CpG blocks with which we performed association testing. Eleven age-associated differentially methylated regions (DMRs) passed Bonferroni correction (P-value < 1.15 × 10-8). Top findings replicated in an independent sample set of 558 subjects using pyrosequencing of bisulfite-converted DNA (min P-value < 10-30). To examine biological themes, we selected 70 DMRs with false discovery rate of <0.1. Of these, 42 showed hypomethylation and 28 showed hypermethylation with age. Hypermethylated DMRs were more likely to overlap with CpG islands and shores. Hypomethylated DMRs were more likely to be in regions associated with polycomb/regulatory proteins (e.g. EZH2) or histone modifications H3K27ac, H3K4m1, H3K4m2, H3K4m3 and H3K9ac.

.....In this study, aged human lens proteins were examined using HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry and a blind PTM search strategy. Multiple thioether modifications of Ser and Thr residues by glutathione (GSH) and its metabolites were unambiguously identified. Thirty-four of 36 sites identified on 15 proteins were found on known phosphorylation sites, supporting a mechanism involving dehydroalanine (DHA) and dehydrobutyrine (DHB) formation through β-elimination of phosphoric acid from phosphoserine and phosphothreonine with subsequent nucleophilic attack by GSH. In vitro incubations of phosphopeptides demonstrated that this process can occur spontaneously under physiological conditions. Evidence that this mechanism can also lead to protein-protein crosslinks within cells is provided where five crosslinked peptides were detected in a human cataractous lens. Nondisulfide crosslinks were identified for the first time in lens tissue between βB2- & βB2-, βA4- & βA3-, γS- & βB1-, and βA4- & βA4-crystallins and provide detailed structural information on in vivo crystallin complexes. These data suggest that phosphoserine and phosphothreonine residues represent susceptible sites for spontaneous breakdown in long-lived proteins and that DHA- and DHB-mediated protein crosslinking may be the source of the long-sought after nondisulfide protein aggregates believed to scatter light in cataractous lenses. Furthermore, this mechanism may be a common aging process that occurs in long-lived proteins of other tissues leading to protein aggregation diseases.

.....We have compared fifteen serine integrases for their utility for DNA manipulations in mammalian cells after first demonstrating that all were functional in E. coli. Chromosomal recombination reporters were used to show that seven integrases were active on chromosomally integrated DNA in human fibroblasts and mouse embryonic stem cells. Five of the remaining eight enzymes were active on extra-chromosomal substrates thereby demonstrating that the ability to mediate extra-chromosomal recombination is no guide to ability to mediate site-specific recombination on integrated DNA. All the integrases that were active on integrated DNA also promoted DNA integration reactions that were not mediated through conservative site-specific recombination or damaged the recombination sites but the extent of these aberrant reactions varied over at least an order of magnitude. Bxb1 integrase yielded approximately two-fold more recombinants and displayed about two fold less damage to the recombination sites than the next best recombinase; φC31 integrase. We conclude that the Bxb1 and φC31 integrases are the reagents of choice for genome engineering in vertebrate cells and that DNA damage repair is a major limitation upon the utility of this class of site-specific recombinase.

.....I developed a multi-tissue predictor of age that allows one to estimate the DNA methylation age of most tissues and cell types. The predictor, which is freely available, was developed using 8,000 samples from 82 Illumina DNA methylation array datasets, encompassing 51 healthy tissues and cell types. I found that DNA methylation age has the following properties: first, it is close to zero for embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells; second, it correlates with cell passage number; third, it gives rise to a highly heritable measure of age acceleration; and, fourth, it is applicable to chimpanzee tissues. Analysis of 6,000 cancer samples from 32 datasets showed that all of the considered 20 cancer types exhibit significant age acceleration, with an average of 36 years. Low age-acceleration of cancer tissue is associated with a high number of somatic mutations and TP53 mutations, while mutations in steroid receptors greatly accelerate DNA methylation age in breast cancer. Finally, I characterize the 353 CpG sites that together form an aging clock in terms of chromatin states and tissue variance. I propose that DNA methylation age measures the cumulative effect of an epigenetic maintenance system. This novel epigenetic clock can be used to address a host of questions in developmental biology, cancer and aging research.

Data found in literature have reported that bacterial endotoxins may be involved in the inflammatory and pathological processes associated with amyloidosis and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In fact, it has been observed that the chronic infusion of the bacterial lipopolysaccharide, the outer cell wall component of Gram negative bacteria, into the fourth ventricle of rats reproduces many of the inflammatory and pathological features seen in the brain of AD patients. In this context, a key player in the pathogenesis of AD is the amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) that is capable of aggregating in fibrils that represent the main component of amyloid plaques. These deposits that accumulate among brain cells are indeed one of the hallmarks of AD. This aggregation in fibrils seems to correlate with Aβ toxic effects. However, recent data have shown that amyloid fibril formation not only results in toxic aggregates but also provides biologically functional molecules; such amyloids have been identified on the surface of fungi and bacteria. The aim of this work was to gain insight intn the influence of bacterial endotoxins on Aβ fibrillogenesis; factors that influence fibril formation may be important for Aβ toxic potential. Following three days of incubation at 37°C, Aβ was organized in compact fibrils and the in vitro Aβ fibrillogenesis was potentiated by the Escherichia coli endotoxin. This suggests the importance of infectious events in the pathogenesis of AD and proposes a new aspect related to the putative pathological factors that can be implicated in the mechanisms involved in Aβ25-35 fibrillogenesis.

Aging tilts the balance in favor of adipocyte differentiation at the expense of osteoblast differentiation, resulting in reduced bone formation and osteopenic disorders, including osteoporosis, in humans and animals. Understanding the mechanisms involved in causing this apparent shift in differentiation and identifying factors that stimulate osteoblast formation while inhibiting adipogenesis are of great therapeutic interest. In this study we report that specific, naturally occurring oxysterols, previously shown to direct pluripotent mesenchymal cells toward an osteoblast lineage, exert their osteoinductive effects through activation of Hedgehog signaling pathway. This was demonstrated by 1) oxysterol-induced expression of the Hh target genes Gli-1 and Patched, 2) oxysterol-induced activation of a luciferase reporter driven by a multimerized Gli-responsive element, 3) inhibition of oxysterol effects by the hedgehog pathway inhibitor, cyclopamine, and 4) unresponsiveness of Smoothened-/- mouse embryonic fibroblasts to oxysterols. Using Patched-/- cells that possess high baseline Gli activity, we found that oxysterols did not dramatically shift the IC50 concentration of cyclopamine needed to inhibit Gli activity in these cells. Furthermore, binding studies showed that oxysterols did not compete with fluorescently labeled cyclopamine, BODIPY-cyclopamine, for direct binding to Smoothened. These findings demonstrate that oxysterols stimulate hedgehog pathway activity by indirectly activating the seven-transmembrane pathway component Smoothened.

The fact that respiration produces NAD from NADH (30,31) as well as the finding that NADH can function as a competitive inhibitor of Sir2 activity (7), reinforce the idea that an increase in the NAD/NADH ratio activates Sir2 during CR. A link between CR and increased mitochondrial metabolism has also been reported in mammals. For example, in mice, CR was found
to increase levels of the endothelial nitric oxide synthase, eNOS, mediating an increase in respiration and mitochondrial biogenesis (20). Concomitant with an increase in eNOS concentration, enhanced expression of the mammalian Sir2 ortholog Sirt1 was observed, thus reinforcing the link between respiration and Sir2 activation (20)."

METHODS: The myoblasts were isolated with mixed digestive enzyme from minced human temporal muscle samples, cultured and purified clonally. The 3rd passage cells were incubated with serum free medium including basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF) and leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF). Morphological change was investigated during incubation period. Immunofluorescence cytochemistry and RT-PCR analysis were used to assess cell differentiation and trans differentiation. RESULTS: After the induction, cells became non-adherent aggregates as neurospheres. The myoblast-derived neurospheres was immuno-positive for nestin. In differentiation condition, they looked like neurons and glial cells and expressed neuronal (microtubule associated protein 2, MAP-2), astrocytic (Glial fibrillary acidic protein, GFAP) and oligodendrocytic (Galactocerebroside, Galc) markers by immunocytochemistry.

    :abstract """BACKGROUND: Telomerase preserves telomeres' function and structure preventing cellular senescence. Its activity is reduced in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of haemodialysis (HD) patients. The purpose of this study is to investigate the potential correlation between increased oxidative stress/inflammation and telomerase activity in PBMC of HD patients. METHODS: Telomerase activity was measured by PCR-ELISA in PBMC isolated from a group of 42 HD patients and 39 subjects with estimated glomerular filtration rate >or=80 mL/min (control group). Serum oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) were also measured in both groups by ELISA. RESULTS: Ox-LDL was negatively correlated to percentage telomerase activity in PBMC (r = -0.506, P = 0.000 in the whole group of 81 HD and normal subjects and r = -0.559, P < 0.001 in HD patients). TNF was also inversely associated with percentage telomerase activity in the whole group studied (r = -0.492, P = 0.000) while IL-10 was not. In stepwise multiple linear regression, taking into consideration the most important characteristics of the HD patients and control group, the only significant predictors for percentage telomerase activity in PBMC were ox-LDL and TNF (beta = -0.421, t = -4.083, P = 0.000 and beta = -0.381, t = -3.691, P = 0.000, respectively) while examining separately HD patients, the predictors for the same parameter were ox-LDL and HD duration (beta = -0.671, t = -4.709, P = 0.000 and beta = -0.349, t = -2.447, P = 0.023, respectively). CONCLUSION: Ox-LDL serum level is inversely correlated to telomerase activity in PBMC of HD patients.

Recent breakthroughs in the understanding of aging have led some to believe that aging can be dramatically slowed, and researchers, such as Cambridge-based Aubrey de Grey, are suggesting that it could be reversed or postponed indefinitely, allowing humans to live for up to several thousand years.

These optimists have spawned a movement of like-minded life extension enthusiasts who call themselves immortalists. The immortalist community is growing steadily as anti-aging breakthroughs and commentary from Aubrey de Grey and other leaders makes headlines in the mainstream press. In de Grey's opinion, people are "beginning to realize that the certainty that aging has always existed and been inevitable is becoming more and more fragile." (3)

Immortalists are working hard to spread the life extension meme and involve more people in the project. Their goal is to elicit support of the mainstream scientific community and close the massive gap between de Grey's predictions of 5000 year lifespans and the more conservative 125-150 year estimates of most biogerentologists.

http://whatfuture.net/docs/dyingtoliveforever.pdf

I see now that you gave him an interview, he attended a lecture, he follows Imminst, etc. You/SENS feature prominently in a skim of the piece. I doubt there's new INFORMATION. FWIW, he appears to think that we have to strongly moderate our messaging:

----------
To involve more people in the  debate on immortalism and in the important task of finding answers to the many  social questions it raises, interested groups must overcome not just the concerns  about life extension, but decades of a sense of science and technology as something inherently risky.     This will not be an easy task for immortalist groups, as it will be difficult for  them to balance the visions and egos of their members with the need for a more  moderate message for the general public. However, if they hope to keep a  leading role in guiding the development of life extension technology, they must  do just that. Losing the dedicated members who founded the groups and made  projects such as the Methuselah Mouse Prize possible would be disastrous for  immortalists, but so would the passage of legislation such as Missouri’s proposed  constitutional amendment to ban genetic enhancement of humans. The  opponents of immortalism and transhumanism are already politically organized  and respected publicly, so to compete in the political arena immortalists must  cultivate this support and respect as well.
--------------

That said, his more concrete proposals are more reasonable:

-------
1. Tolerate religion
2. Separate life extension from the Singularity
3.  Affirm commitment to choice: ... Immortalist discourse has emphasized choice, but at this  point still ridicules choices other than extended lifespans. A commitment  to choice could also help remove the threat of transhuman eugenics ...
-----------

unfortunately while they can be done by "leaders" individually, there's no way IMO to make the first 2 shifts in the LE/transhumanist population at large, and in a world of blogs etc and with a largely libertarian community, a "party line" that is so contrary to almost all of our personal beliefs & instincts will be impossible to maintain or present to the media when it would so clearly be unrepresentative and when sensationalism, hype, and snark are staples of media.

    :abstract """Phage PhiC31 integrase has potential as a means of inserting therapeutic genes into specific sites in the human genome. However, the possible interactions between PhiC31 integrase and cellular proteins have never been investigated. Using pLexA-PhiC31 integrase as bait, we screened a pB42AD-human fetal brain cDNA library for potential interacting cellular proteins. Among 61 positives isolated from 10(6) independent clones, 51 contained DAXX C-terminal fragments. The strong interaction between DAXX and PhiC31 was further confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation. Deletion analysis revealed that the fas-binding domain of DAXX is also the region for PhiC31 binding. Hybridization between a PhiC31 integrase peptide array and an HEK293 cell extract revealed that a tetramer, 451RFGK454, in the C-terminus of PhiC31 is responsible for the interaction with DAXX. This tetramer is also necessary for PhiC31 integrase activity as removal of this tetramer resulted in a complete loss of integrase activity. Co-expression of DAXX with PhiC31 integrase in a HEK293-derived PhiC31 integrase activity reporter cell line significantly reduced the PhiC31-mediated recombination rate. Knocking down DAXX with a DAXX-specific duplex RNA resulted in increased recombination efficiency. Therefore, endogenous DAXX may interact with PhiC31 causing a mild inhibition in the integration efficiency. This is the first time that PhiC31 was shown to interact with an important cellular protein and the potential effect of this interaction should be further studied.""" ;

    dc:title "Multiple, non-allelic, intein-coding sequences in eukaryotic RNA polymerase genes" ;
    :abstract """BACKGROUND: Inteins are self-splicing protein elements. They are translated as inserts within host proteins that excise themselves and ligate the flanking portions of the host protein (exteins) with a peptide bond. They are encoded as in-frame insertions within the genes for the host proteins. Inteins are found in all three domains of life and in viruses, but have a very sporadic distribution. Only a small number of intein coding sequences have been identified in eukaryotic nuclear genes, and all of these are from ascomycete or basidiomycete fungi. RESULTS: We identified seven intein coding sequences within nuclear genes coding for the second largest subunits of RNA polymerase. These sequences were found in diverse eukaryotes: one is in the second largest subunit of RNA polymerase I (RPA2) from the ascomycete fungus Phaeosphaeria nodorum, one is in the RNA polymerase III (RPC2) of the slime mould Dictyostelium discoideum and four intein coding sequences are in RNA polymerase II genes (RPB2), one each from the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, the zygomycete fungus Spiromyces aspiralis and the chytrid fungi Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis and Coelomomyces stegomyiae. The remaining intein coding sequence is in a viral relic embedded within the genome of the oomycete Phytophthora ramorum. The Chlamydomonas and Dictyostelium inteins are the first nuclear-encoded inteins found outside of the fungi. These new inteins represent a unique dataset: they are found in homologous proteins that form a paralogous group. Although these paralogues diverged early in eukaryotic evolution, their sequences can be aligned over most of their length. The inteins are inserted at multiple distinct sites, each of which corresponds to a highly conserved region of RNA polymerase. This dataset supports earlier work suggesting that inteins preferentially occur in highly conserved regions of their host proteins. CONCLUSION: The identification of these new inteins increases the known host range of intein sequences in eukaryotes, and provides fresh insights into their origins and evolution. We conclude that inteins are ancient eukaryote elements once found widely among microbial eukaryotes. They persist as rarities in the genomes of a sporadic array of microorganisms, occupying highly conserved sites in diverse proteins.""" ;

It is now realized that lysosomes instead are quite vulnerable, although in a heterogeneous way. Their exposure to a number of events, such as oxidative stress, lysosomotropic detergents and aldhydes, as well as overexpression of the p53 protein, causes time-and-dose-dependent lysosomal rupture that is followed by apoptosis or necrosis. Partial lysosomal rupture has often been found to be an early upstream event in apoptosis, while necrosis results from fulminant lysosomal rupture.

Accurate interpretation of RGCs, however, is critically dependent on appropriate sampling of the character state of interest amongst relevant taxa. Dinoflagellates form the sister taxon to Apicomplexa, and therefore the state of their cox2 is essential to the interpretation of this apparent RGC.

during progression of liver cells (i) the replication of nuclear and mitochondrial genomes is synchronized during cellular proliferation, (ii) the accretion of OXPHOS proteins is asynchronously regulated during proliferation being the synthesis of beta-F1-ATPase and Hsp60 carried out also at G2/M and, (iii) the biosynthesis of cardiolipin is achieved during the S phase, although full development of the mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim) is attained at G2/M. Furthermore, we demonstrate using reporter constructs that the mechanism regulating the accretion of beta-F1-ATPase during cellular proliferation is controlled at the level of mRNA translation by the 3'UTR of the transcript. The 3'UTR-driven synthesis of the protein at G2/M is essential for conferring to the daughter cells the original phenotype of the parental cell. Our findings suggest that alterations on this process may promote deregulated beta-F1-ATPase expression in human cancer.

We examined the anterior horns of the lumbar spinal cord in 14 patients with sporadic ALS and 15 age-matched controls by electron microscopy to illuminate the subject. In the controls, one patient showed occasional swollen mitochondria with markedly increased cristae and marked accumulation of mitochondria in the somata of anterior horn neurons. Another patient had periodic, stubby protrusions on the outer membrane. Among the patients with ALS, 7 showed filamentous structures in the inner compartment of the mitochondria mainly of the somata and only occasionally of the axons. The structures were composed of a stack of multilayered cristae consisting of linear structures on a longitudinal section. Other abnormal structures were periodic transverse processes like rungs of a ladder predominantly in somata and only occasionally in the axons, marked accumulation of mitochondria in the somata, dendrites or proximal axons (axon hillock and initial segment), stubby protrusions on the outer membrane, and swollen mitochondria with markedly increased cristae in the somata.

Aging microglia were characterized by the presence of lipofuscin granules, decreased processes complexity, altered granularity, and increased mRNA expression of both pro-inflammatory (TNFalpha, IL-1beta, IL-6) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10, TGFbeta1) cytokines. Following lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge (1 mg/kg, 3 h), aging microglia exhibit increased basal expression of TNFalpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, and IL-10. Yet, the fold-over-basal LPS response remained constant across age, implying that the inflammatory machinery in aging microglia is functional and adjusted to the basal state. Gender differences were not overall observed across the treatments (age, LPS). The low but sustained production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by aging microglia may have a profound impact in the brain aging process.""" .

Importantly, expression of an Rfa1-t11-Ddc2 hybrid fusion protein restored checkpoint-dependent arrest, but did not rescue defective telomeric recombination. Therefore, the Rfa1-t11-associated defect in telomeric recombination is not solely due to its failure to recruit Mec1. We have also isolated novel alleles of RFA1 that were deficient in Type I but not in Type II recombination and proficient in checkpoint control. Therefore, the checkpoint and recombination functions of RPA can be genetically separated, as can the RPA-mediated control of the two types of telomeric recombination.""" .

    :abstract """Several studies have demonstrated a good correlation between clinical severity and Braak's neuropathological staging in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, nonagenarians and centenarians display a different pattern of cortical vulnerability to the neurodegenerative process compared to younger elderly, and it is not known whether correlations between clinical severity and neuropathological stages remain valid in this age group. To address this issue we compared Clinical Dementia Rating scale (CDR) scores and Braak stages in 116 patients over 90 years of age with either no cognitive impairment or very mild to severe AD. There is a strong positive correlation between CDR scores and Braak staging (Spearman coefficient = 0.66; P < 0.01). However, neuropathological staging does not distinguish cases with normal cognition (CDR 0) from those with mild cognitive changes (CDR 0.5). Unlike younger cohorts, Braak stages I and II are frequently associated with questionable dementia in this age group. Braak stage III overlaps with all CDR levels and correlates poorly with cognitive function. Braak stages IV or greater are consistently associated with at least mild dementia. Consistent with our previous neuropathological analyses of nonagenarians and centenarians, the present data suggest that the substantial involvement of the hippocampus which characterizes Braak stage IV is a key step in the development of overt clinical signs of dementia in the oldest-old. Moreover, they indicate that Braak staging represents a broad concept of the evolution of neurofibrillary tangles rather than a precise hierarchical model associated with a stepwise deterioration of cognitive abilities near the upper limit of life.""" .

All of the Narave share two PC mtDNA sequences, one of which matches the sequence of a Narave collected in 1927, consistent with an unbroken maternal descent of these intersex pigs from the original pigs brought to Vanuatu 3,200 years ago. One-third of the Kapia share a single PC lineage also found in the Narave. The remaining Kapia lineages are associated with recently introduced, globally distributed domestic breeds. The predominant Narave lineage is also shared with two wild boars from Vietnam. These data suggest that PC pigs were recently domesticated within Southeast Asia and dispersed during the human colonization of Remote Oceania associated with the Lapita cultural complex.

DESIGN: Evaluation of CSF beta-amyloid(40) (Abeta(40)), Abeta(42), tau, phosphorylated tau(181), and plasma Abeta(40) and Abeta(42) and longitudinal clinical follow-up (from 1 to 8 years). SETTING: Longitudinal studies of healthy aging and dementia through an AD research center.

    :text """ First the finding of reduced CSF Abeta42 is surprising granted
the finding of HIGH *ratios* of 42:40 in the blood is present in, and
predicts, AD in other studies. It's interesting & makes me wonder if (a)
the latter is just a matter of the ratio itself, not the level (which
could stilll be the product of low Abeta42, so long as it was higher
than 40), and more importantly if (b) the CSF data is a result of more
AGGREGATION of 42, with the result of lower release into CSF -- but
then, what is triggering more aggregation if (presumably) production is
the same (since if production were higher, you'd have to have MUCH more
aggregation to lower CSF levels -- tho' perhaps there's a snowballing
effect, in which high production leads to triggering nucleation and a
rapid expansion of the plaque, which soaks up oligomers that would
otherwise hit the CSF)?

Even less claer what the significance of the tau:42 is, unless it's just
a secondary phenomenon to lower Abeta42.

IAC, it's not clear that there is a therapeutic/engineering significance
to this, so I'll just drop it unless you advise otherwise.

Then again (as if on cue), maybe THIS is the explanation: [17210196]

Familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) results from PS mutations, which may alter gamma-secretase activity to enhance the production of highly aggregable Abeta42. The precise pathogenic effects of mutant PS remain unclear. To exclude the effects of endogenous PS, we established cell lines from PS1/PS2-deficient (PS-/-) fibroblasts capable of stably expressing either wild-type (wt) PS1 or different mutant PS1s. Although both wt PS1 and mutant PS1 formed gamma-secretase complexes of the same size and containing the same components, the amount of Abeta secreted by FAD mutant PS1-expressing cells was significantly reduced. The ratio of Abeta42 to Abeta40 (Abeta42/Abeta40) secreted by these cells, however, was significantly higher than that secreted by cells expressing wt PS1, which corroborated findings from a previous report. The elevated Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio observed with mutant PS1-expressing cells may be due to reduced Abeta40 production not increased Abeta42 production.""" ;

    :abstract """Progressive cerebral deposition of the amyloid beta-protein (Abeta) is believed to play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The highly amyloidogenic 42-residue form of Abeta (Abeta42) is the first species to be deposited in both sporadic and familial AD. Mutations in two familial AD-linked genes, presenilins 1 (PS1) and 2 (PS2), selectively increase the production of Abeta42 in cultured cells and the brains of transgenic mice, and gene deletion of PS1 shows that it is required for normal gamma-secretase cleavage of the beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) to generate Abeta. To establish the subcellular localization of the PS1 regulation of APP processing to Abeta, fibroblasts from PS1 wild-type (wt) or knockout (KO) embryos as well as Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably transfected with wt or mutant PS1 were subjected to subcellular fractionation on discontinuous Iodixanol gradients. APP C-terminal fragments (CTF) were markedly increased in both endoplasmic reticulum- (ER-) and Golgi-rich fractions of fibroblasts from KO mice; moreover, similar increases were documented directly in KO brain tissue. No change in the subcellular distribution of full-length APP was detectable in fibroblasts lacking PS1. In CHO cells, a small portion of APP, principally the N-glycosylated isoform, formed complexes with PS1 in both ER- and Golgi-rich fractions, as detected by coimmunoprecipitation. When the same fractions were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for Abetatotal and Abeta42, Abeta42 was the major Abeta species in the ER fraction (Abeta42:Abetatotal ratio 0.5-1.0), whereas absolute levels of both Abeta42 and Abeta40 were higher in the Golgi fraction and the Abeta42:Abetatoal ratio was 0.05-0.16 there. Mutant PS1 significantly increased Abeta42 levels in the Golgi fraction. Our results indicate PS1 and APP can interact in the ER and Golgi, where PS1 is required for proper gamma-secretase processing of APP CTFs, and that PS1 mutations augment Abeta42 levels principally in Golgi-like vesicles.""" .

    :abstract """Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the presence of cytoplasmic inclusions composed of alpha-synuclein (alpha-syn) in dopaminergic neurons. This suggests a pivotal role of dopamine (DA) on PD development. Here, we show that DA modulates differently the stability of protofibrils (PF) and fibrils (F) composed of wild type or variants of alpha-syn (A30P and A53T) as probed by high hydrostatic pressure (HHP). While in the absence of DA, all alpha-syn PF exhibited identical stability, in its presence, the variant-composed PF acquired a greater stability (DAPFwt < DAPFA30P = DAPFA53T), implying that they would last longer, which could shed light onto why these mutations are so aggressive. When alpha-syn was incubated for long times (18 days) in the presence of DA, we observed the formation of F by electronic microscopy, suggesting that the PF trapped in the presence of DA in short times can evolve into F. The stability of F was also altered by DA. DAFwt was more labile than Fwt, indicating that the former would be more susceptible to breakage. PFA30P and DAPFA30P, when added to mesencephalic and cortical neurons in culture, decreased the number and length of neurites and increased the number of apoptotic cells. Surprisingly, these toxic effects of PFA30P and DAPFA30P were practically abolished with HHP treatment, which was able to break the PF into smaller aggregates, as seen by atomic force microscopy.

ERT  was proposed in theory as early as 1988, and progress has evidently been rapid. I see from Cooper that not all forms are the result of a missing native enzyme, which would mean that NATIVE ERT woiuld presumably not be effective, making xenohydrolases an attractive therapeutic alternative. Indeed, I now see from the full text of the above that "One potential drawback to ERT in the context of the NCLs is that ERT is only effective for treatment of disorders involving soluble proteins. This would limit the use of ERT to treatment of PPT-1 (INCL), TPP-1 (LINCL) and cathepsin D deficiency, since the other CLN proteins 3,5,6 and 8 are all membrane bound proteins." I also see, consistent with one's expectations for any LSD including aging, that a mitochondrial component (Comp V subunit c) is prominent in the dysfunctional lysosomes in NCL. This combination should lead to work that could be especially readily leveraged into the SENS research agenda.

Hobert & Dawson also mentions the use of convection perfusion to deliver enzymes across the BBB -- an option I came across & originally mentioned re the dendrimerized version of BCNT in ch 10 of the book, and I see was not mentioned in your reviews.

We therefore conducted a mechanistic study of PNPase biogenesis in the mitochondrion. Interestingly, PNPase is localized to the intermembrane space by a novel import pathway.

In a yeast strain deleted for Yme1 and expressing PNPase, nonimported PNPase accumulated in the cytosol, confirming an in vivo role for Yme1 in PNPase maturation. PNPase localization to the mitochondrial intermembrane space suggests a unique role distinct from its highly conserved function in RNA processing in chloroplasts and bacteria.

The 8-oxodGTP was incorporated opposite dC in the template with a specificity constant of 0.005 microM(-1) s(-1), a value approximately 10,000-fold lower than that for dGTP. Once incorporated, 96% of the time 8-oxodGMP was extended by continued polymerization rather than being excised by the proofreading exonuclease. The specificity constant for incorporation of 8-oxodGTP opposite a template dA was 0.2 microM(-1) s(-1), a value 13-fold higher than incorporation opposite a template dC. The 8-oxodG:dA mispair was extended rather than excised at least 70% of the time. Examination of the kinetics of polymerization with 8-oxodG in the template strand also revealed relatively low fidelity in that dCTP would be incorporated only 90% of the time. In nearly 10% of events, dATP would be incorporated, and once incorporated dA (opposite 8-oxodG) was extended rather than excised. The greatest fidelity was against a dTTP:8-oxodG mismatch affording a discrimination value of only 1800. These data reveal that 8-oxodGTP is a potent mutagen. Once it is incorporated into DNA, 8-oxodGMP codes for error prone DNA synthesis. These reactions are likely to play important roles in oxidative stress in mitochondria related to aging and as compounded by nucleoside analogs used to treat human immunodeficiency virus infections.""" .

    :excerpt """... it has recently been discovered that some enzyme inhibitors can
actually increase the amount of enzyme activity when added to cells
derived from people with a lysosomal storage disorder. These
small-molecule inhibitors have been referred to as pharmacological
chaperones.

...  Although some missense mutations ablate enzyme activity, for
example by altering an active-site residue, most cause problems with
protein folding that are due to their impact on the structure of the
protein involved. This phenomenon has been reported for a number of
lysosomal storage disorders  ... [in which] the misfolding of a mutant
protein early in the biosynthetic pathway, and its [resulting] premature
degradation ... is a principal reason for the onset of pathogenesis.
Pharmacological chaperones can enhance the folding of mutant protein,
preventing this recognition-degradation process and increasing the
traffic of the protein out of the RER...

In most cases, if affected individuals had normal levels of the *mutant*
protein, this would provide sufficient enzyme catalytic capacity to
avert the clinical onset of the disorder. Moreover, in most lysosomal
storage disorders, only 1–5% of normal enzyme activity is required to
avoid the onset of clinical symptoms. This implies that a small change
in the amount of residual enzyme activity could result in a substantial
change in clinical phenotype, by averting the onset of pathogenesis.

... This type of therapy is also an attractive option because small
molecules ... can often be administered orally and, given wide
biodistribution, may be able to penetrate problem sites of pathology—for
example, the central nervous system ...""" .

The polyQ diseases are caused by abnormal expansion of a polyQ stretch in each disease-causing protein, which triggers these proteins to form aggregates. We previously showed that genetic expression of the aggregate inhibitor peptide polyQ binding peptide 1 (QBP1) suppresses polyQ-induced neurodegeneration in Drosophila. However, to establish a molecular therapy using QBP1, QBP1 needs to be delivered into cells by its administration. In this study, we employed protein transduction domains (PTDs) to enable the efficient intracellular delivery of QBP1. We show here that fusion with a PTD enables the efficient intracellular delivery of QBP1, and that PTD-QBP1 treatment suppressed polyQ-induced cytotoxicity in cultured cells. Most importantly, oral administration of PTD-QBP1 successfully suppressed polyQ-induced premature death as well as polyQ inclusion body formation in a Drosophila model of the polyQ diseases, demonstrating its therapeutic effect against polyQ-induced neurodegeneration in vivo.

FA results from a deficiency of the mitochondrial protein frataxin brought about by a repeat expansion in intron 1 of the FRDA gene. The main areas affected are the central nervous system (particularly the spinocerebellar system) and cardiac tissue. Therapies aimed at alleviating the neurological degeneration have proved unsuccessful to date. Here, we describe the construction and delivery of high capacity herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) amplicon vectors expressing the entire 80 kb FRDA genomic locus, driven by the endogenous FRDA promoter and including all introns and flanking regulatory sequences within a 135 kb genomic DNA insert. FA patient primary fibroblasts deficient in frataxin protein and exhibiting sensitivity to oxidative stress were transduced at high efficiency by FRDA genomic locus vectors. Following vector transduction, expression of FRDA protein by immunofluorescence was shown. Finally, functional complementation studies demonstrated restoration of the wild-type cellular phenotype in response to oxidative stress in transduced FA patient cells. These results suggest the potential of the infectious bacterial artificial chromosome-FRDA vectors for gene therapy of FA.""" ;

Our results indicate that cell transplantation improved cardiac function at 6-months observation. The frequency of apoptotic cells in the peri-infarcted myocardium 3 days after cell transplantation was significantly decreased in the cell transplantation group. EDC therapy decreased the protein levels of cleaved caspase 3 and Bax, and increased the level of Bcl-2 in comparison to myocardial infarction control. Additionally, the number of apoptotic cells decreased significantly in cardiomyocytes precocultured with EDCs.

Such antibodies are able to sequester peripheral AbetaP, thus avoiding passage through the blood brain barrier (BBB) and, as recently shown in a transgenic mouse model, to cross the BBB and dissolve already formed beta-amyloid plaques. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to use as a vaccine a self-anti-aggregating epitope displayed on a phage, and this may pave the way to treat abnormal accumulation-peptide diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease or other amyloidogenic diseases.""" ;

    :abstract """The view that mitochondrial electron transport is the only site of aerobic respiration and the primary bioenergetic pathway in mammalian cells is well established in the literature. Although this paradigm is widely accepted for most tissues, the situation is less clear for proliferating cells. Increasing evidence indicates that glycolytic ATP production contributes substantially to fulfilling the energy requirements of rapidly dividing somatic cells, many tumour cells, and self-renewing stem cells in hypoxic environments. Glycolytic cells have been shown to consume oxygen at the cell surface via plasma membrane electron transport (PMET), a process that oxidises intracellular NADH, supports glycolytic ATP production and may contribute to aerobic energy production. PMET, as determined by reduction of a cell-impermeable tetrazolium dye, is highly active in rapidly-dividing tumour cell lines, where it ameliorates intracellular reductive stress, originating from the mitochondrial TCA cycle. Thus, mitochondrial NADH production is linked to dye reduction outside the cell via the malate-aspartate shuttle. PMET activity increases several-fold under hypoxic conditions, consistent with the view that oxygen competes for electrons from this PMET system. In addition, rho(o) cells that lack mitochondrial electron transport are characterised by elevated PMET presumably to recycle NADH, a role traditionally assumed by lactate dehydrogenase. PMET presents an excellent target for developing novel anticancer drugs that exploit its unique plasma membrane localisation. We propose that PMET is a ubiquitous, high-capacity acute NADH redox-regulatory system responsible for maintaining the mitochondrial NADH/NAD+ ratio. Blocking this pathway compromises the viability of rapidly proliferating cells that rely on PMET.""" ;

Previous studies have demonstrated an important role for the thymus not only in central deletional tolerance, but also in the induction of peripheral tolerance by vascularized renal allografts in juvenile miniature swine recipients. The same protocol did not induce tolerance in thymectomized recipients nor in recipients beyond the age of thymic involution. We subsequently reported that vascularized thymic lobe grafts from juvenile donors were capable of inducing tolerance in thymectomized juvenile hosts. However, the important question remained whether aged, involuted thymus could also induce tolerance if transplanted into thymectomized hosts, which, if true, would imply that thymic involution is not an intrinsic property of thymic tissue but is rather determined by host factors extrinsic to the thymus. We report here that aged, involuted thymus transplanted as a vascularized graft into juvenile recipients leads to rejuvenation of both thymic structure and function, suggesting that factors extrinsic to the thymus are capable of restoring juvenile thymic function to aged recipients. We show furthermore that rejuvenated aged thymus has the ability to induce transplant tolerance across class I MHC barriers.

However, the influence of amyloid-beta-containing brain environment on the development of HNPCs is unknown. Recently, we demonstrated that amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) impaired differentiation of HNPCs in culture through oxidative stress. Now we studied the effect of neprilysin, an Abeta-degrading enzyme, on development of neuronal colonies from neurospheres of HNPCs in the presence of Abeta1-40. Neprilysin increased the number of neurospheres that formed colonies of neuron-like cells. This effect of neprilysin was associated with reduced amounts of the monomeric and dimeric Abeta that remained in culture supernatants as well as the Abeta uptaken by differentiating HNPCs. Phosphoramidon, a neprilysin inhibitor, attenuated these effects of neprilysin. In control cultures of HNPCs that grew without exogenous Abeta1-40, the treatment with neprilysin reduced the number of developing colonies. This effect might result from degradation by neprilysin of endogenous Abeta produced and secreted by HNPCs or other peptides that are involved in neuronal development. The results demonstrate that even a partial reduction of extracellular Abeta levels by neprilysin may facilitate development of HNPCs into neurons in an environment overloaded with Abeta.

Optical densitometry revealed a robust age-related increase in alpha-synuclein protein within individual nigral neurons in both species.

The age-related increases in nigral alpha-synuclein were non-aggregated and strongly associated with age-related decreases in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), the rate limiting enzyme for dopamine production. In fact, only cells expressing alpha-synuclein displayed reductions in TH.

First, protein misfolding and inclusion formatioin would presumably PRECEDE and LEAD TO lysosomal failure, following which inclusions would tend to build up & perhaps lead to necrosis.

Second, if cells are losing dopaminergic functionality, that ought to be sufficient alone to produce PD symptoms, even without inclusions & subsequent loss of the neurons themselves.

This now adds AS to soluble Abeta spp and tau as cases where evidence suggests that the precursor species of the aggregates are (a big part of) the problem. IF clearing out the aggregates lowers the precursor levels (as with immunization for Abeta), great; if not (as seems probable for lyso enhancement), I continue to be concerned that we're going to have a problem here, unless/until we can find a way to deal with the (putative, per engineer's logic) damage that leads to the pathological increase in soluble spp level.  The potential for immunization against tau as well as NFT (PMID: 17095156 above) gives some optimsism on that front, at least.

First, DNA damage and unrepaired double-strand breaks (DSBs) accumulate with age. Second, several defects in DNA repair genes are associated with early onset of age-related diseases and other signs of premature aging. Now, a third link has emerged: The mechanisms by which cells repair DSB damage can change dramatically with age, shifting from simpler end-joining processes in younger organisms to homologous mechanisms in which missing genetic information is restored through use of a template. So far this third link between aging and DNA repair has only been observed in a small number of experimental systems, and cannot yet claim the generality of the other two.

    :text """Clearly, this is what the research to which the Engels abstract alluded.   It would seem that this is likely irrelevant to PPCD IAC because it's in Drosophila and in the germ line, but just to double-check I looked at the full text: the relevant section ( Possible Causes of Age-Dependent Changes in DSB Repair) suggests entirely mechanisms that don't seem to bear on the subject: "Changes in cell-cycle stage and timing can affect the choice of repair pathways [17]. Recent work [5] shows that the duration of the cell cycle increases with age in Drosophila male germline stem cells. A slower cell cycle could favor HR by allowing more time for DNA synthesis. ... The increased use of HR in older individuals could also result from changes in histone acetylation or other chromatin properties. A recent report [33] shows that mutations that cause hypoacetylation also result in increased use of HR relative to NHEJ in somatic cells ... Age-dependent DSB repair could reflect a shift in the composition of the population of stem cells. For example, cell selection might act to favor those stem cells that have undergone HR-h specifically at our reporter construct or cells that have a heritable propensity for using HR-h in general.... We see no apparent basis for either of these postulates.

One exception is one that more openly just takes the whole question out of the issue at hand -- SOMATIC, not germline, aging: "Another way the stem-cell population might shift is suggested by recent work showing that regenerated stem cells can form from spermatagonial cells in Drosophila [35]. Therefore, as the male ages, its population of stem cells may change to include a greater proportion of these regenerated cells or cells derived from symmetric stem-cell divisions [5]."

The only thing that might redeem this work in terms of my original interst is a statement in the first abstract (the Engels Cell Cycle paper) that "So far this [phenomenon] has only been observed in a *small number* [presumably, not n=1] of experimental systems ... Here we review the evidence for this phenomenon and present new data testing models for the underlying causes.

    :abstract """The composition of an atherosclerotic plaque is an important determinant of plaque stability. Unstable rupture-prone plaques are characterized by a thin fibrous cap that contains few muscle cells. Several lines of evidence suggest that macrophage activation in the unstable shoulder of the plaque could contribute to plaque rupture by releasing toxic factors, possibly nitric oxide (NO), to smooth muscle cells. These macrophages are also involved in the uptake of apoptotic cells (AC) and the inefficient removal of the latter might contribute to the formation of the necrotic core through accumulation of necrotic debris. Furthermore, these AC rapidly expose phosphatidylserine on their surface, which is a potent substrate for the generation of thrombin and activation of the coagulation cascade. The following new insights in the etiopathogenesis of atherothrombosis will be discussed: (1) Human atherosclerotic plaques contain amyloid precursor protein (APP) and beta-amyloid peptide, which is cleaved from APP and which has been extensively studied in Alzheimer's disease. Macrophages phagocytose platelets,which contain APP in their alpha-granules and this platelet derived APP is subsequently proteolytically processed in these macrophages into beta-amyloid The latter is involved in the upregulation of the inducible NO-synthase which results in an increased production of toxic amounts of NO. (2) Phagocytosis of the pro-coagulant ACS is severely impaired in advanced human atherosclerotic plaques. Several factors present in the atherosclerotic lesion,such as accumulation of indigestible material in the macrophage cytoplasm,oxidative stress,and the presence of oxidized LDL or oxidized erythrocytes may contribute to the impairment of phagocytosis. (3) In order to study the impact of the impaired phagocytosis by the macrophages on the atherosclerotic lesion development,a double knock-out mouse was created which spontaneously develops atherosclerosis combined with a deficient phagocytotic capacity. Completely unexpected the double-knock out mouse developed an until now not described phenotype resembling the metabolic syndrome including a spectacular increase in body weight,accumulation of abdominal fat and fat in the liver and increased plasma levels of cholesterol. Furthermore the atherosclerotic lesions demonstrated a striking different morphology as compared to the lesions present in mice which spontaneously develop atherosclerosis.""" ;

atherogenic diet developed significant atherosclerotic lesions.
Interestingly, although atherogenic diet-fed B6Tg2576 mice and
non-transgenic littermates had similar plasma lipoprotein cholesterol
profiles, B6Tg2576 mice developed significantly more aortic
atherosclerotic lesions than did non-transgenic mice. Unexpectedly,
B6Tg2576 mice fed a normal diet also developed small but significant
early atherosclerotic lesions in the aorta root although their
lipoprotein cholesterol profiles were normal. Non-transgenic
littermates, however, showed no atherosclerosis on a normal diet.
Immunohistochemical analyses showed the co-localization of ß-amyloid

The plasma Aß level ... is increased in Tg2576 mice.  As Aß can be taken
up by vascular smooth muscle cells, the development of atherosclerotic

It has been hypothesized that the ability of stem cells to maintain tissue homeostasis declines functionally with age and that this decline may account for many of the biological phenotypes associated with aging. Recently, tumor suppressors such as p53 have been implicated in both aging and the regulation of stem cell dynamics. Our recent findings suggest that p53 may impact hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) dynamics during mammalian aging. Utilizing mouse models of varying levels of p53 dosage, we have shown that alteration of p53 activity affects stem cell number, proliferation, and functionality with age. Several other recent studies have implicated other tumor suppressors in potential age-related regulation of HSC dynamics as well. These data support a model in which aging is caused in part by a decline in tissue stem cell regenerative function, regulated in part by tumor suppressors.""" .

pretty depressing for even for *intra*-species nuclear transfer, in
terms of both the purging of one mtDNA vs the other and in terms of how
bad heteroplasmy is when it happens, and looks a bit alarming for the
limited stuff on interspecies work (the 2nd below is on 2 bovine spp;
human donors into bovine eggs looks pretty depressing). It certainly
looks like we still have to worry about it as a technical challenge at

To investigate this, we optimised at the single cell level the recently developed method to screen the entire mtDNA for mainly heteroplasmic mutations by denaturing high performance liquid chromatography analysis. This method is sensitive (approximately 1% heteroplasmy detectable), specific and rapid. The entire mtDNA of 26 oocytes of 13 women was screened by this method. Ten different heteroplasmic mutations, of which only one was located in the D-loop and two were observed twice, were detected in seven oocytes with mutation loads ranging from <5% to 50%. From eight women >1 oocyte was received and in four of them heteroplasmic differences between oocytes of the same woman were observed. In one of these four, two homoplasmic D-loop variants were also detected. Additionally, four oocytes of a single woman were sequenced using the MitoChip (which lacks the D-loop region), but all sequences were identical. It is concluded that heteroplasmic mtDNA mutations are common in oocytes and that, depending on the position and mutation load, they might increase the risk of developing OXPHOS disease early or later in life.""" ;

This study explored plasma alphaSN as a diagnostic marker for PD. Western blot analysis was used to characterize plasma alphaSN compared to brain alphaSN. Plasma alphaSN of 16 kDa migrates with the same mobility as its brain counterpart and recombinant alphaSN on denatured polyacrylamide gels and reacted with three different antibodies against the C-terminal and NAC regions of the alphaSN protein. The alphaSN levels in plasma from PD subjects are significantly lower than that in age-matched controls (p=0.001), and the alphaSN levels in patients with early-onset PD are lower than that in both late-onset PD and controls.

While AGEs have been shown to accumulate in a variety of collagenous human tissues and alter the tissues' functional behavior, the role of AGEs in modifying the mechanical properties of cancellous bone is not well understood. In this study, an in vitro ribosylation model was used to examine the effect of NEG on the mechanical behavior of cancellous bone. Cancellous bone cores and individual trabeculae were harvested from the femoral heads of eight fresh human cadavers and paired for ribosylation and control treatments. The cores were subjected to either unconfined compression tests or were demineralized and subjected to stress relaxation tests. The trabeculae were loaded to fracture in four-point bending. In vitro NEG significantly reduced the energy dissipation characteristics of the organic matrix as well as the post-yield properties including the stiffness loss of the individual trabeculae (p<0.05) and the damage fraction of cancellous bone (p<0.001). AGEs in cancellous bone cores from both treatment groups correlated with damage fraction (r(2)=0.36, p<0.05) and post-yield strain energy (r(2)=0.21, p<0.05); and with energy dissipation characteristics of the organic matrix (r(2)=0.35, p<0.05).

"Primary" in time or in importance? It'd be good to have *direct* evidence that lysosomes can deal with actual aggregates; is this just an hypothesis at this time, based on the fact that they deal with a lot of junk and that inclusion bodies and disease-related aggregates (and other recalcitrant junk) are found in lysosomes, and the absence of glowing graveyards?

Instead, different proteolytic systems can simultaneously contribute to the degradation of a particular protein, or they can alternate in this task depending, for the most part, on the cellular conditions. It is thus reasonable to expect that some level of communication exists among different proteolytic systems to orchestrate these coordinated activities. Direct cross-talk between two forms of autophagy, macroautophagy and chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) has been recently demonstrated. Cells respond to blockage of CMA by upregulating macroautophagy. Although macroautophagy cannot completely substitute for the lack of CMA, the partial redundancy between both pathways allows some level of compensation, enough to maintain protein degradation and preserve cell homeostasis. Understanding the cross-talk among different autophagic pathways and with other proteolytic systems is important to predict the type of compensatory mechanisms that could be elicited in response to failure of one of these systems, and to understand the consequences that manipulating one of these pathways for therapeutic purposes could have on the activity of the other pathways.""" .

But ``Direct cross-talk between two forms of autophagy, macroautophagy and chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) has been recently demonstrated,`` if true, suggests otherwise. It'd be problematic if junk only ultimately found its way to lyso if the other elements of the system were working to send it there (tho' of course the alternative is that fully cleaned-out lysos will allow for proper functioning of proteasome etc -- but this assumes no chicken/egg problem  based on the above).

``macroautophagy cannot completely substitute for the lack of CMA`` -- how strong is the evidence for this, and is it only because macroautophagy can't deal with some junk but could after enhancement? ``partial redundancy between both pathways allows some level of compensation, enough to maintain protein degradation and preserve cell homeostasis." suggests that it is already enough for a while, and if enhanced might be adequate indefinitely on standard engineering "maintain low damage levels`` principles.

In this case, engineering logic notwithstanding, the final sentence does seem justified.

    :abstract """Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (CMG cells) are multipotent and can be induced by 5-azacytidine to differentiate into cardiomyocytes. We characterized the electrophysiological properties of these cardiomyocytes and investigated their potential for use as transplantable bio-pacemakers. After differentiation, action potentials in spontaneously beating cardiomyocytes were initially sinus node-like, but subsequently became ventricular cardiomyocyte-like. RT-PCR established that ion channels mediating I(K1) and I(Kr) were expressed before differentiation. After differentiation, ion channels underlying ICa,L and If were expressed first, followed by ion channels mediating I(to) and I(K,ATP). Differentiated CMG cells expressed beta-adrenergic receptors and increased their beat rate in response to isoproterenol. CMG cardiomyocytes were purified using GFP fluorescence and transplanted into the free walls of the left ventricles of mice. The transplanted cardiomyocytes survived and connected to surrounding recipient cardiomyocytes via intercalated discs.

    :abstract """In this article we discuss relevant data on aging, longevity, and gender with particular focus on inflammation gene polymorphisms which could affect an individual's chance to reach the extreme limit of human life. The present review is not an extensive revision of the literature, but rather an expert opinion based on selected data from the authors' laboratories. In 2000-2005 in the more developed regions, the life expectancy at birth is 71.9 years for men (78.3 in Japan) and 79.3 years for women (86.3 in Japan). Indeed, gender accounts for important differences in the prevalence of a variety of age-related diseases. Considering people of far-advanced age, demographic data document a clear-cut prevalence of females compared to males, suggesting that sex-specific mortality rates follow different trajectories during aging. In Italy this female/male ratio is relatively lower (about 5/1; F/M ratios are usually 5-6:1 in other developed countries), but significant differences have been observed between Italian regions in the distribution of centenarians by gender--from two women per man in the South to more than eight in certain regions in the North. Thus, a complex interaction of environmental, historical, and genetic factors, differently characterizing the various parts of Italy, likely plays an important role in determining the gender-specific probability of achieving longevity. This can be due to gender-specific cultural and anthropological characteristics of Italian society in the last 100 years. Age-related immunoinflammatory factors increase during proinflammatory status, and the frequency of pro/anti-inflammatory gene variants also show gender differences. There is some suggestion that people genetically predisposed to weak inflammatory activity may be at reduced chance of developing coronary heart disease (CHD) and, therefore, may achieve longer lifespan if they avoid serious life-threatening infectious disease thoroughout life. Thus, the pathogen burden, by interacting with host genotype, could determine the type and intensity of the immune-inflammatory response responsible for both proinflammatory status and CHD. These findings point to a strong relationship between the genetics of inflammation, successful aging, and the control of cardiovascular disease, but seem to suggest that the evidence for men is much stronger. The importance of these studies lies in the fact that half of the population (males) lives approximately 10% shorter lives than the other half (females). Understanding the different strategies that men and women seem to follow to achieve longevity may help us to comprehend better the basic phenomenon of aging and allow us to search for safe ways to increase male lifespan.""" ;

Identification of small molecules that effectively reduce brain levels of Abeta is important for development of Abeta-lowering agents for AD. In this study, we demonstrate that in vivo Abeta levels in brain are significantly reduced by the cysteine protease inhibitor E64d and the related CA074Me inhibitor, which inhibits cathepsin B. Direct infusion of these inhibitors into brains of guinea pigs resulted in reduced levels of Abeta by 50-70% after 30 days of treatment. Substantial decreases in Abeta also occurred after only 7 days of inhibitor infusion, with a reduction in both Abeta40 and Abeta42 peptide forms. A prominent decrease in Abeta peptides was observed in brain synaptosomal nerve terminal preparations after CA074Me treatment. Analyses of APP-derived proteolytic fragments showed that CA074Me reduced brain levels of the CTFbeta fragment, and increased amounts of the sAPPalpha fragment. These results suggest that CA074Me inhibits Abeta production by modulating APP processing. Animals appeared healthy after treatment with these inhibitors.

    :abstract """hTERT, which encodes the catalytic subunit of telomerase and is expressed in most immortalized and cancer cells, has been reported to have increased DNA methylation in its promoter region in many cancers. This pattern is inconsistent with observations that DNA methylation of promoter CpG islands is typically associated with gene silencing. Here, we provide a comprehensive analysis of promoter DNA methylation, chromatin patterns, and expression of hTERT in cancer and immortalized cells. Methylation-specific PCR and bisulfite sequencing of the hTERT promoter in breast, lung, and colon cancer cells show that all cancer cell lines retain alleles with little or no methylation around the transcription start site despite being densely methylated in a region 600 bp upstream of the transcription start site. By real-time reverse transcription-PCR, all cancer cell lines express hTERT. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis reveals that both active (acetyl-H3K9 and dimethyl-H3K4) and inactive (trimethyl-H3K9 and trimethyl-H3K27) chromatin marks are present across the hTERT promoter. However, using a novel approach combining methylation analysis of ChIP DNA, we show that active chromatin marks are associated with unmethylated DNA, whereas inactive marks of chromatin are associated with methylated DNA in the region around the transcription start site. These results show that DNA methylation patterns of the hTERT promoter (-150 to +150 around the transcription start) are consistent with the usual dynamics of gene expression in that the absence of methylation in this region and the association with active chromatin marks allow for the continued expression of hTERT.""" .

    :abstract """The 40 and 42 amino-acid residue forms of amyloid beta (Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42)) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) have been proposed as potential biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Quantitative analyses of Abeta peptides in CSF have relied almost exclusively on the use of immunoassay-based assays such as the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) procedure. However, due to the ability of the Abeta peptides to readily self-aggregate or bind to other proteins and glassware, such analyses are extremely challenging. Analyses are further complicated by the potential of the peptides to undergo post-translational modifications and the possibilities for cross-reaction in the ELISA assays with endogenous components of the CSF. An approach based on liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) has now been developed which overcomes these methodological issues. The key steps in implementing this new approach involved immunoaffinity purification coupled with the use of [15N]-labeled Abeta peptides as internal standards, a basic LC mobile phase, negative ion electrospray ionization, and a basic solvent for dissolving the peptides and washing the injection needle to prevent carryover of analytes during multiple injections on the LC/MS system. The validated method had limits of quantitation of 44 fmol/mL (200 pg/mL) for Abeta(1-42) and 92 fmol/mL (400 pg/mL) for Abeta(1-40). An excellent correlation was found between the LC/MS/MS assay and an ELISA assay for Abeta(1-42) in human CSF (r2 = 0.915), although less correlation was observed for Abeta(1-40) (r2 = 0.644). Mean CSF Abeta(1-42) concentrations for samples collected 2 weeks apart from a limited number of AD patients provided additional confidence in the reproducibility of the LC/MS/MS assay. Concentrations for duplicate samples from AD patients were slightly higher than most previously reported values (mean 1.06 +/- 0.25 ng/mL; n = 7). Abeta(1-40) concentrations in duplicate samples obtained from AD patients were also reproducible but were found to be slightly lower than most previously reported values (mean 6.36 +/- 3.07 ng/mL; n = 7). Consistent with literature reports, mean Abeta(1-42) concentrations were found to be lower in AD patients compared with the normal subjects (mean 1.49 +/- 0.59 ng/mL; n = 7), whereas there was no difference in Abeta(1-40) concentrations between AD patients and normal subjects (mean 5.88 +/- 3.03 ng/mL; n = 7). The accuracy and precision of the LC/MS assay mean that it will be a useful complement to existing ELISA assays for monitoring therapeutic interventions designed to modulate CSF Abeta(1-42) concentrations in individual AD patients. Moreover, the introduction of stable isotope labeled internal standards offers the potential to achieve a more rigorous account of the influence of methodological effects related to sample collection and processing.""" ;

OTOH, if the ATP is extracellular, could it possibly somehow be induced on a localized and periodic basis to help fuel an ATP-driven AGE breaker?

The result is consistent with etiological findings that ultraviolet irradiation and ageing, both of which are accelerators of AGE formation, are closely related to the development of CDK.""" .

    dc:title "Impact of donor age on the growth of young recipient rats after liver transplantation" ;
    :abstract """PURPOSE: We studied the age-related changes in graft livers, and their impact on post-transplantation liver function and the growth of young recipient rats. METHODS: Rats aged 11-68 weeks old were studied as controls to assess liver histology, liver function, and body weight. We performed orthotopic liver transplantation using Kamada's cuff technique without arterial reconstruction. Young rats aged 11 weeks were randomized to receive livers from either 11-week-old donors (YD group) or 52-week-old donors (OD group). Recipient rats were killed 0, 8, or 16 weeks after surgery and we assessed the same variables as in the controls. RESULTS: We confirmed an age-related increase in the average size of hepatocytes and their nuclei. These age-related changes persisted and progressed in the graft liver after transplantation. There were no significant differences in the levels of serum transaminases or total bilirubin between the YD and OD groups, but the serum albumin level was significantly lower in the OD group. The YD group grew normally, whereas the OD group recipients lagged significantly in gaining body weight. CONCLUSION: We found that 52-week-old grafts transplanted into 11-week-old recipients resulted in deficient growth and a decline in serum albumin, suggesting that grafted old livers fail to produce enough protein to meet the demands of growth adequately.""" ;

Substantial uncoupling and loss of cellular [ATP] indicative of mitochondrial dysfunction with age was found in the hand muscle. In contrast, stable mitochondrial function was found in the leg muscle in support of the notion that mild uncoupling is protective against mitochondrial damage with age. Greater mitochondrial dysfunction is evident in muscles with higher type II muscle fiber content, which may be at the root of the preferential loss of type II fibers found in the elderly." The link to actual cell loss is significant, IMO, and the specific choice of the hand was happy: preservation of hand-grip strength is a repeatedly-reported predictor of "successful aging" and/or longevity in epidemiological studies, and this pair of findings is thus highly suggestive of a MiFRA-based mechanism.

To assess the potential role of mitochondrial dysfunction in the onset of muscle fiber death in this form of dystrophy, we studied biopsies and myoblast cultures obtained from patients with different genetic defects of collagen VI and variable clinical presentations of the disease. We identified a latent mitochondrial dysfunction in myoblasts from patients with Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy that matched an increased occurrence of spontaneous apoptosis. Unlike those in myoblasts from healthy donors, mitochondria in cells from patients depolarized upon addition of oligomycin and displayed ultrastructural alterations that were worsened by treatment with oligomycin. The increased apoptosis, the ultrastructural defects, and the anomalous response to oligomycin could be normalized by Ca(2+) chelators, by plating cells on collagen VI, and by treatment with cyclosporin A or with the specific cyclophilin inhibitor methylAla(3)ethylVal(4)-cyclosporin, which does not affect calcineurin activity.

    :text """Now, thsi MAY be a more important confirmation than would appear from the abstract. As it says, PINK1 has been identified as " a causative gene of autosomal recessive early-onset parkinsonism" -- but it's been MUTATIONS in the gene that have been thus identified, and several studies seem to show that such mutations are absent (PMID: , 16046032, 15349859, ) or very rare  (PMID: 17172567 finds it, rarely, and indeed in 16482571 it's present in just 3.7% in an Asian cohort of early-onset cases) in "normal" and/or sporadic PD.

Yet this, and apparently least 1 previous study (PMID: 16702191) (whcih reported that " PINK1 is detected in a proportion of Lewy bodies in cases of sporadic Parkinson's disease and Parkinson's disease associated with heterozygous mutations in the PINK1 gene, which are clinically and pathologically indistinguishable from the sporadic cases. PINK1 was absent in cortical Lewy bodies, in neurofibrillary tangles in Alzheimer's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal degeneration, *and* [NB, FWIW] in the glial and neuronal alpha-synuclein positive inclusions in multiple system atrophy" ), are still finding the protein in the inclusion bodies of -- ie, it's not NECESSARILY linked to mutations.

This study also found that "PINK1 is localized to the mitochondrial membranes" in rat and human brain." PMID: 15824318 finds that overexpression of PINK1 leads to mitochondrial localizatioin combined with some distribution of  the C-terminal to the cytosol after proteolytic cleavage, and PMID: 16672981 seeems to be saying explicitly that the PROTEIN is mitochondrial in Drosophila, where (per the simultaneously-published PMID: 16672980) it is associated with (minor) loss of dopaminergic neurons rescued by parkin overexpression.

So there are several possibilities for the role of PTEN. One is some FUNCTIONAL problem with the MUTANT PINK1 (reduced kinase activiyt, eg - PMID: 15824318 again - or "PINK1 appears to protect against mitochondrial damage" - PMID: 15952880) in PARK6, but that wouldn't seem to explain its wider finding in PD inclusion bodies granted that mutations are rare. Another is that it's like AD, loosely: there is an increased vulnerability to aggregation in mutant forms, but een the regular stuff winds up aggregating in others.

But I'm also wondering if its presence in sporadic AD inclusions may just be  a coincidence of its mitochondrial localization: damaged mt get  targeted to the lysosome, and so one is really tracking the other. PINK1 is also apparently ubiquitinated, and ubiquitination gene mutations (Parkin,  UCH-L1) are linked to risk, so the healthy protein could wind up  in the lysosome  when either stochastic damage is too much for the proteasome, or the proteasome fails for other reasons and it becomes recalcitrant to lysosomal degradation following further stochastic assault while stuck in the deactivated proteasome.""" .

Adult stem cells were harvested from pancreatic tissue of patients undergoing operative procedures including the pancreas. The cells were selected, cultured and passaged. To promote self-differentiation into cardiomyocytes, human pancreatic stem cells were co-cultered with biopsies of human myocardium. After co-culture and breeding, cells were phenotyped as well with respect to RNA, protein and cardiomyocyte specificity at the electron-microscopic level.Pancreatic stem cells have already differentiated spontaneously into cardiomyocyte-like cells performing netlike cell clusters with rare but distinct multilocular cellular autonomous contractions with a frequency of about 20 beats per minute. The number of contracting areas however could be enhanced by co-culture with human myocardial biopsies.

We might avoid the latter if we could produce such cells from ESC or SCNT.

    :abstract """Transplantation of a tissue-engineered heart muscle represents a novel experimental therapeutic paradigm for myocardial diseases. However, this strategy has been hampered by the lack of sources for human cardiomyocytes and by the scarce vasculature in the ischemic area limiting the engraftment and survival of the transplanted muscle. Beyond the necessity of endothelial capillaries for the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to the grafted muscle tissue, interactions between endothelial and cardiomyocyte cells may also play a key role in promoting cell survival and proliferation. In the present study, we describe the formation of synchronously contracting engineered human cardiac tissue derived from human embryonic stem cells containing endothelial vessel networks. The 3D muscle consisted of cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells (ECs), and embryonic fibroblasts (EmFs). The formed vessels were further stabilized by the presence of mural cells originating from the EmFs. The presence of EmFs decreased EC death and increased EC proliferation. Moreover, the presence of endothelial capillaries augmented cardiomyocyte proliferation and did not hamper cardiomyocyte orientation and alignment.

Specimens were evaluated for CFDA, MyoD and DAPI staining, as well as for mRNA expression of muscle specific genes. Results showed enhanced fibrin resorption in dependence of AV loop presence. Transplanted myoblasts could be detected in the AV loop group even after 8 weeks by CFDA-fluorescence, still showing positive MyoD staining. RT-PCR revealed gene expression of MEF-2 and desmin after 4 weeks on the AVloop side, whereas expression analysis of myogenin and MHC(embryo) was negative. So far myoblast injection in the microsurgical rat AV loop model enhances survival of the cells, keeping their myogenic phenotype, within pre-vascularised fibrin matrices.

A total of 154 cases of different types of soft tissue sarcoma (54 low-grade, 40 intermediate-grade, and 60 high-grade cases) were evaluated for hTERT expression using immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays. hTERT immunoexpression was detected in 59% of cases; it was observed in 46%, 58%, and 72% of low-grade, intermediate-grade, and high-grade sarcoma cases, respectively. The intensity of staining positively correlated with the grade of the sarcomas: diffuse strong positive nuclear staining was identified in 6, 8, and 30 cases of low-grade, intermediate-grade, and high-grade sarcomas, respectively.

    :text """AFAICS, they are jumping well ahead of their data with that conclusion. The full text notes that "Once the bound lipoproteins are endocytosed [from the plasma into the liver], the various lipids, including cholesteryl esters, are hydrolyzed in the a acidic environment of the late endosomes/lysosomes. The unesterified cholesterol is then transferred using the activities of both NPC2 and NPC1 to the metabolically active pool of sterol in the cytosol." Thus, NPC1 mutations lead to a " block in movement of unesterified cholesterol out of the late endosomal/lysosomal compartment in cells of the liver and other tissues," and hepatic accumulation of unesterified cholesterol ensues.

However, "cholesterol that reaches the liver through the HDL/SR-BI pathway or that is synthesized locally in the liver reaches this metabolically active pool of sterol without passing through the late endosomal/lysosomal compartment". And despite the 'somal sequestration that ensues, "there is no shortage of sterol in the metabolically active pool of these cells. This is because de novo synthesis increases to supply adequate amounts of cholesterol for turnover of membrane sterol and for the synthesis of bile acids".

Now, the greater cholesterol accumulation in the mutants must indeed be attributable to the mutation, but they never do measure the level of unesterified material. So ISTM that the correlation could well be CAUSALLY related to the material that doesn't go thru' the 'some in the first place, or due to some metabolic abnormality subsequent to the increase in biosynthesis, which latter would of course be CORRELATED directly to the level of deficit induced by 'somal entrapment but under such a scenario the cell death would actually have nothing DIRECTLY to do with lysosomal dysfunction. to be a bit overconfident to say that "Taken together, the results of these experiments strongly suggest that it is, indeed, the magnitude and duration of the expansion of the pool of unesterified cholesterol in the late endosomal/lysosomal compartment that somehow initiates liver cell damage. By inference, this finding further suggests that the signal for this damage likely is coming from the late endosomal/lysosomal compartment of these cells."

It's also somewhat curious to me that this happens in the liver, which is of course a mitotic tissue, etc, but the most superficial of Googles reveals that hepatic lysosomal engorgement & damage is a feature of several LSDs (Hurler syndrome & Pompe disease as well as Niemann-Pick). They don't normally exocytose, and the hepatocytes don't automatically keep dividing all the time like epidermal cells, but was still a surprise.""" .

    :abstract """Oxysterols such as 7-ketocholesterol and 25-hydroxycholesterol formed under enhanced oxidative stress in the brain are suggested to induce neuronal cell death. The present study investigated the effect of calmodulin antagonists (trifluoperazine, W-7 and calmidazolium) against the cytotoxicity of 7-ketocholesterol in relation to the mitochondria-mediated cell death process and oxidative stress. PC12 cells exposed to 7-ketocholesterol revealed nuclear damage, decrease in the mitochondrial transmembrane potential, cytosolic accumulation of cytochrome c, activation of caspase-3, increase in the formation of reactive oxygen species and depletion of GSH. N-Acetylcysteine, trolox, carboxy-PTIO and Mn-TBAP reduced the cytotoxic effect of 7-ketocholesterol. Calmodulin antagonists attenuated the 7-ketocholesterol-induced nuclear damage, formation of the mitochondrial permeability transition and cell viability loss in PC12 cells. The results suggest that calmodulin antagonists may prevent the 7-ketocholesterol-induced viability loss in PC12 cells by suppressing formation of the mitochondrial permeability transition, leading to the release of cytochrome c and subsequent activation of caspase-3. The effects seem to be ascribed to their depressant action on the formation of reactive oxygen species and depletion of GSH. The findings suggest that calmodulin inhibition may exhibit a protective effect against the neurotoxicity of 7-ketocholesterol.""" ;

    :abstract """BACKGROUND: We employ an approach based on the elaborated frailty index (FI), which is capable of taking into account variables with mild effect on the aging, health and survival outcomes, and investigate the connections between the FI, chronological age and the aging-associated outcomes in the elderly. METHODS: Cross-sectional analysis of pooled data from the National Long Term Care Survey (NLTCS) assessing health and functioning of the U.S. elderly in 1982, 1984, 1989, 1994, and 1999. RESULTS: Distributions of frequency, residual life span, mortality rate, and relative risk of death are remarkably similar over age and FI. Coefficients of correlation between FI and age are low both for males (0.127, p<.01) and females (0.221, p<.01). The FI-specific age patterns show deceleration at advanced ages. The FI can provide order of magnitude better resolution in estimating mean remaining life span compared to age. Males have smaller FI than females while males' mortality risks are higher. For short-time horizons, the FI and age are largely independently associated with mortality risks. CONCLUSIONS: The FI: (i) can be considered as an adequate sex-specific indicator of the aging-associated processes in the elderly, (ii) can characterize these processes independently of age, and (iii) is a better characteristic of the aging phenotype than chronological age.""" ;

    :abstract """PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The aim of this article is to review recent developments in the search for the etiologic agent of Kawasaki disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Two recently proposed theories of Kawasaki disease etiology, the toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 hypothesis and the coronavirus NL-63 hypothesis, have been studied extensively and have been disproven. Surprisingly, IgA plasma cells infiltrate inflamed tissues in acute Kawasaki disease, including the coronary artery, and are oligoclonal, or antigen-driven. Synthetic versions of predominant IgA antibodies in acute Kawasaki disease arterial tissue bind to an antigen present in acute Kawasaki disease ciliated bronchial epithelium and in a subset of macrophages in acute inflamed Kawasaki disease tissues. Light and electron microscopic studies of the antigen in acute Kawasaki disease ciliated bronchial epithelium indicate that the Kawasaki disease-associated antigen localizes to cytoplasmic inclusion bodies that are consistent with aggregates of viral protein and associated nucleic acid. SUMMARY: The identification of cytoplasmic inclusion bodies in acute Kawasaki disease ciliated bronchial epithelium has provided direction for future Kawasaki disease etiology studies. Transmission electron microscopic examination of glutaraldehyde-fixed medium-sized bronchi from acute Kawasaki disease fatalities and analysis of the protein and nucleic acid components of the inclusions should provide important information about these inclusion bodies and speed the identification of the specific etiologic agent of Kawasaki disease.""" ;

We hypothesized that reduced-intensity (RI) conditioning regimens would allow stable engraftment of therapeutically transduced cells and allow correction of Fabry disease. We transplanted transduced cells into Fabry mice receiving eight different clinically relevant chemotherapy- and/or radiotherapy-based RI conditioning regimens generating modest and transient lymphoid/myeloid cell depletion. Two comprehensive transplantation Protocols were performed. Firstly, transplantation of 0.38 x 10(6) gene-modified stem/progenitor cells was nominally effective; none of the RI regimens led to stable alpha-galactosidase A (alpha-gal A) correction. Secondly, transduced cells were preselected for functional transgene expression and transplanted at a higher dose (0.72 x 10(6) cells). Each RI regimen yielded engraftment of functional transgene-positive cells through 180 days along with increased plasma alpha-gal A activity. Importantly, the RI regimens mediated broad organ enzyme correction and were not associated with immune responses against alpha-gal A. RI conditioning thus has an important role in gene therapy for LSDs; a variety of regimens can be effective in this context.""" ;

    :abstract """Mitochondrial dysfunction is implicated in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease (PD), a common age-associated neurodegenerative disease characterized by intraneuronal inclusions (Lewy bodies) and progressive degeneration of the nigrostriatal dopamine (DA) system. It has recently been demonstrated that midbrain DA neurons of PD patients and elderly humans contain high levels of somatic mtDNA mutations, which may impair respiratory chain function. However, clinical studies have not established whether the respiratory chain deficiency is a primary abnormality leading to inclusion formation and DA neuron death, or whether generalized metabolic abnormalities within the degenerating DA neurons cause secondary damage to mitochondria. We have used a reverse genetic approach to investigate this question and created conditional knockout mice (termed MitoPark mice), with disruption of the gene for mitochondrial transcription factor A (Tfam) in DA neurons. The knockout mice have reduced mtDNA expression and respiratory chain deficiency in midbrain DA neurons, which, in turn, leads to a parkinsonism phenotype with adult onset of slowly progressive impairment of motor function accompanied by formation of intraneuronal inclusions and dopamine nerve cell death. Confocal and electron microscopy show that the inclusions contain both mitochondrial protein and membrane components. These experiments demonstrate that respiratory chain dysfunction in DA neurons may be of pathophysiological importance in PD.""" ;

MATERIALS: Fibroblastoid-type cells obtained from amniotic fluid at the time of birth. METHODS: The ability of ex vivo expansion was investigated until senescence, and stem cell-like characteristics were analyzed by examining differentiation potential, messenger RNA expression and immunophenotypes. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: A morphologically homogenous population of fibroblastoid-type (HAFFTs) cells, similar to mesenchymal stem cells from bone marrow (BM-MSCs), was obtained at the third passage. The cells became senescent after 27 passages over a period of 8 months while undergoing 66 population doublings. Under appropriate culture conditions, by the 8th passage they differentiated into adipocytes, osteocytes, chondrocytes and neuronal cells, as revealed by oil red O, von Kossa, Alcian blue and anti-NeuN antibody staining, respectively. Immunophenotype analyses at the 17th passage demonstrated the presence of TRA-1-60; SSEA-3 and-4; collagen types I, II, III, IV and XII; fibronectin; alpha-SMA; vimentin; desmin; CK18; CD44; CD54; CD106; FSP; vWF; CD31; and HLA ABC. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis of the HAFFTs from passages 6-20 showed consistent expression of Rex-1, SCF, GATA-4, vimentin, CK18, FGF-5 and HLA ABC genes. Oct-4 gene expression was observed up to the 19th passage but not at the 20th passage. HAFFTs showed telomerase activity at the 5th passage with a decreased level by the 21st passage. Interestingly, BMP-4, AFP, nestin and HNF-4alpha genes showed differential gene expression during ex vivo expansion. Taken together, these observations suggest that HAFFTs are pluripotent stem cells that are less differentiated than BM-MSCs, and that their gene expression profiles vary with passage number during ex vivo expansion.""" ;

In fact, in addition to bone, cartilage, fat, and myoblasts, it has been demonstrated that MSCs are capable of differentiating into neurons and astrocytes in vitro and in vivo. MSCs are of interest because they are isolated from a small aspirate of bone marrow and can be easily expanded in vitro. As such, these cells are currently being tested for their potential use in cell and gene therapy for a number of human diseases. Nevertheless, there are still some open questions about origin, multipotentiality, and anatomical localization of MSCs. In this review, we discuss clinical trials based on the use of MSCs in cardiovascular diseases, such as treatment of acute myocardial infarction, endstage ischemic heart disease, or prevention of vascular restenosis through stem cell-mediated injury repair. We analyze data from clinical trials for treatment of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), which is a genetic disease characterized by production of defective type I collagen. We describe progress for neurological disease treatment with MSC transplants. We discuss data on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and on lysosomal storage diseases (Hurler syndrome and metachromatic leukodystrophy). A section of review is dedicated to ongoing clinical trials, involving MSCs in treatment of steroid refractory Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD); periodontitis, which is a chronic disease affecting periodontium and causing destruction of attachment apparatus, heart failure, and bone fractures.

However, one of the main problems is to limit the development of ischaemic fibrosis during tissue maturation. We describe a model using the omentum as an in vivo bioreactor for a previously seeded scaffold. METHODS: Bladder biopsies were taken from five female pigs, from which both urothelial and smooth muscle cells cultures were made. These cultured cells were used to seed a sphere-shaped small intestinal submucosa (SIS) matrix, which was transferred into the omentum after 3 wk of cell growth. The grafts were harvested 3 wk later and histologic, immunohistochemical, and functional studies were performed. RESULTS: We obtained a highly vascularized tissue-engineered construct that contracted in response to acetylcholine stimulation. The wall thickness was 4mm, on average. Histologic and immunostaining analysis of the construct confirmed the presence of a multilayer urothelium on the luminal aspect and deeper fascicles organised tissue composed of differentiated smooth muscle cells and mature fibroblasts without evidence of inflammation or necrosis. Large- and small-diameter vessels were clearly identified histologically in the tissue obtained. CONCLUSION: The omentum permitted in vivo maturation of seeded scaffolds with the development of a dense vascularisation that is anticipated to prevent fibrosis and loss of contractility.

The effect of hAPP and PS1 overexpression on cognition has been well characterised in a variety of transgenic mouse models, however, non-cognitive behaviours have not been considered as systematically. The non-cognitive behaviour of the hAPP/PS1 transgenic mouse model (TASTPM) was observed at ages spanning the rapid progression of amyloid neuropathology. TASTPM transgenic mice, of both genders, exhibited decreased spontaneous motor activity, disinhibition, increased frequency and duration of feeding bouts, reduced body weight and, by 10 months, increased activity over a 24h period. In addition to the aforementioned behaviours, male transgenic mice also displayed enhanced aggression relative to wildtype controls.

    :abstract """Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly. Cardinal pathologic features of AD are amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, and most in the field believe that the initiating events ultimately leading to clinical AD center on disordered metabolism of amyloid beta protein. Mouse models of AD have been created by inserting one or more human mutations associated with disordered amyloid metabolism and that cause early onset familial AD into the mouse genome. Human-like amyloid plaque formation increases dramatically with age in these transgenic mice. Amyloid reduction in humans is a major therapeutic objective, and AD transgenic mice allow controlled study of this biology. Recent work has shown that amyloid plaques as small as 35 microm can be detected using in vivo magnetic resonance microimaging (MRMI) at high magnetic field (9.4 T). In addition, age-dependent changes in metabolite concentration analogous to those that have been identified in human AD patients can be detected in these transgenic mice using single-voxel (1)H magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H MRS) at high magnetic field. These MR-based techniques provide a new set of tools to the scientific community engaged in studying the biology of AD in transgenic models of the disease. For example, an obvious application is evaluating therapeutic modification of disease progression. Toward the end of this review, the authors include results from a pilot study demonstrating feasibility of using MRMI to detect therapeutic modification of plaque progression in AD transgenic mice.""" ;

The amyloid plaque labeling agent that is most widely used ... [is] Pittsburgh compound-B, or PIB. ... PIB for PET is currently in human use at a number of academic sites. Commercial development of PIB is in progress, which should make this amyloid imaging compound even more accessible in coming years. Although PIB has been in experimental human use only since 2002, results from academic sites in the United States and Europe have been uniformly positive, validating the initial claim that PIB effectively labels amyloid deposits in the brain of living human subjects (Fagan and others 2006). However, micro-PET studies evaluating the labeling of amyloid plaques in transgenic AD mice with PIB have not been successful to date (Klunk and others 2005). One explanation for the discrepancy  ... is a lower number (by roughly 2 orders of magnitude) of PIB binding sites in plaques in transgenic mice versus those in human AD subjects (Klunk and others 2005). This discrepancy, in turn, may be related to the much faster rate at which plaques develop in transgenic mice compared to human AD subjects". See also, in the same search day: [17226978]""" .

Moreover, a separate and very fast relaxation (e.g., relaxation time tau approximately 2 micros at 90 degrees ) can be noticed for both the glycated DNAs at all the studied scattering angles.

However, "active" Abeta vaccination strategies for the treatment of cerebral amyloidosis without concurrent induction of detrimental side effects are lacking. We have developed a transcutaneous (t.c.) Abeta vaccination approach and evaluated efficacy and monitored for deleterious side effects, including meningoencephalitis and microhemorrhage, in WT mice and a transgenic mouse model of AD. We demonstrate that t.c. immunization of WT mice with aggregated Abeta(1-42) plus the adjuvant cholera toxin (CT) results in high-titer Abeta antibodies (mainly of the Ig G1 class) and Abeta(1-42)-specific splenocyte immune responses. Confocal microscopy of the t.c. immunization site revealed Langerhans cells in areas of the skin containing the Abeta(1-42) immunogen, suggesting that these unique innate immune cells participate in Abeta(1-42) antigen processing. To evaluate the efficacy of t.c. immunization in reducing cerebral amyloidosis, transgenic PSAPP (APPsw, PSEN1dE9) mice were immunized with aggregated Abeta(1-42) peptide plus CT. Similar to WT mice, PSAPP mice showed high Abeta antibody titers. Most importantly, t.c. immunization with Abeta(1-42) plus CT resulted in significant decreases in cerebral Abeta(1-40,42) levels coincident with increased circulating levels of Abeta(1-40,42), suggesting brain-to-blood efflux of Abeta.

    :excerpt """The kinetics of amyloidosis is characterized by a lag phase during which all the prerequisites are present but no fibrils are formed. Once a critical nucleus of amyloid is formed, the conditions change to favour aggregation with very fast kinetics.4 The lag phase can last from weeks to years. For example, in a mouse model for AA amyloidosis, amyloid fibrils are formed in the spleen in response to injection of an inflammatory stimulus after a lag phase of 3–4 weeks. It has been known for a long time that this lag period can be shortened dramatically to 3 days by the simultaneous injection of extracts of spleen from amyloidotic mice.5 The activity of this amyloid-enhancing factor (AEF) has been shown to depend on small molecules with a beta-sheet structure. It acts as a template for amyloid fibrillogenesis to begin, similar to a snowflake that starts growing from a speck of dirt.6 Not only AEF generated from AA fibrils can thus shorten the lag period, but other types of amyloid fibrils have also been shown to act as AEF in AA amyloidosis, including AL amyloid fibrils.7,8


... To test this hypothesis [for "the dual expression of AA and AL amyloidosis in the same patient and the rapid progressive course"] we used a well-defined cell culture model of AA amyloidosis in which isolated human monocytes are incubated with recombinant SAA (150 mg L-1) for 7 days, with or without mouse spleen-derived AEF.9,10 Monocytes were isolated from a patient suffering from AL amyloidosis and four healthy volunteers. ...  after 7 days of incubation cells of healthy volunteers make amyloid fibrils only when they are simultaneously exposed to AEF. However, monocytes from the patient with AL amyloidosis showed extensive AA amyloid deposition even without co-incubation with AEF. This suggests that the previous exposure to AL amyloid fibrils acts as an AEF to enhance AA amyloid formation. In conclusion, AL amyloid fibrils may act as AEF for AA amyloidogenesis.""" .

GALNS is required to degrade keratan sulfate (KS) and chondroitine-6-sulfate (C6S). The accumulation of undegraded substrates in lysosomes of the affected tissues leads to a systemic bone dysplasia. Total urine glycosaminoglycans (GAG) in patients with MPS IVA are close to the normal range so it is difficult to distinguish this disease based on urine GAG excretion. Another potential disease marker could be KS levels in urine and plasma. Although the enzymatic diagnosis of affected patients with MPS IVA can be made, the detection of obligate heterozygotes by enzymatic measurement is less reliable because of a marked overlap of GALNS in fibroblasts or leucocytes from affected phenotype and normal controls. The genetic heterozygoty of MPS IVA has been facilitated by the isolation and characterization of the full lengh cDNA encoding human GALNS. Conventional therapy is symptomatic and limited to palliative procedures, which have virtually no impact upon mortality. To date, there is still no general consensus about the effectiveness of bone marrow transplantation. In the future, gene therapy could represent a great therapeutic improvement.""" ;

For this purpose, we intraperitoneally injected pancreatic cell culture supernatant (PCCS), from normal pancreas, into streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice for 15 consecutive days. The PCCS-treated mice showed sustained reversal in 77.77% of experimental diabetic mice as evidenced by restoration of normoglycemia, increase in serum insulin levels and occurrence of neo islets in histopathological studies during a two month follow up, as opposed to the control diabetic mice which remained hyperglycemic throughout. In order to examine the potential of PCCS to bring about the regeneration of islets, we treated intra-islet precursor cells with PCCS in vitro, which led to the neogenesis of islets as evidenced by dithiozone and insulin immunostaining. These findings substantiate our hypothesis and make the search for regenerative factors converge towards the pancreas and its immediate surroundings. Such regenerative approaches, in combination with other therapeutic strategies to promote islet neogenesis may, in future, provide a cure and/or better means for the control and management of diabetes.""" ;

Huh. Yet more surprises about the environmental influences on
the cells. I'm quite surprised, as this implies that STZ doesn't just
destroy existing, functional islets, but that something in those islets
was required maturatioin of their precursors, implying perhaps that
age-related death woiuld do the same, creating a self-sustaining
gridlock. Such an effect would ISTM likely be invisible in IDDM because
of the effects of ONGOING autoimmune destruction of islets as they
emerged, so that eg the Edmonton protocol wouldn't lead to spontaneous
regeneration of the islets.

Astoundingly, I see (a) that there's evidence that there is an even
trickier regulatory system at work here, and (b) that similar effects
have been demonstrated with a factor originally isolated from healthy
pancreas using "partial duct obstruction" [etc]

These authors do cite a study on INGAP and the related research, but don't mention the protein specifically. I now give a whack of edited abstracats  on teh subject, going from big-picture reviews to finer details:""" .

    :abstract """The proliferative capacity of adult pancreatic islet cells is limited, although the formation of new islets from cells associated with the ductal epithelium is achievable even in the adult gland. Understanding the mechanism whereby proliferation and subsequent differentiation of putative precursor cells leads the appearance of new islets, i.e., islet neogenesis, may be important as a modality for treatment of both Type I and type II diabetes, in which there is an absolute or relative deficiency of insulin. It appears that certain genes and their protein products are essential to the initiation of the initial step in the pathway. We have shown that partial obstruction of the hamster pancreas is able to reverse streptozotocin-induced diabetes more than 50% of the time. An extract, termed ilotropin, prepared from obstructed pancreata, also reverses the diabetes, whereas extracts of control non-obstructed pancreata do not. Ilotropin contains a protein that is heat and acid stable with MW around 20-45 kDa that is capable of stimulating the proliferation of isolated duct cells in culture. Using mRNA and a differential display technique, 20 genes were found to be expressed in the partially obstructed (regenerating), but not the non-obstructed (non-regenerating) pancreas. One of these islet neogenesis-associated proteins (INGAP) proved to be unique to the obstructed pancreas, and a peptide contained within the sequence was capable of stimulating the proliferation of ductal cells in culture. INGAP was found to be expressed early in the neogenic process before the onset of ductal cell proliferation, and was capable of stimulating tritiated thymidine uptake into protodifferentiated epithelial cells, compatible with the notion that it might be involved in initiating the process of islet neogenesis.""" .

Administration of Ilotropin, a protein extract isolated from CW pancreata, causes recapitulation of normal islet ontogeny and reverses STZ diabetes, reducing mortality by 50%. We investigated the hypothesis that a novel gene encoding a constituent of Ilotropin was expressed in the hamster pancreas undergoing islet neogenesis. Islet neogenesis associated protein (INGAP) is a product of a novel gene expressed in regenerating hamster pancreas. Northern blot analysis showed a strong single transcript of 850 bp at 1 and 2 d after CW that disappeared by the 6th day and was absent from untreated control pancreata. INGAP gene is expressed in acinar cells, but not in islets. Western blot analysis demonstrated the presence of INGAP in Ilotropin but not in extracts from control pancreata. A synthetic pentadecapeptide, corresponding to a region unique to INGAP, stimulated a 2.4-fold increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation into hamster duct epithelium in primary culture and a rat pancreatic duct cell line but had no effect on a hamster insulinoma tumor cell line. A portion of human INGAP gene was cloned and appears to be highly homologous to the hamster gene. This data suggests that the INGAP gene is a novel pancreatic gene expressed during islet neogenesis whose protein product is a constituent of Ilotropin and is capable of initiating duct cell proliferation, a prerequisite for islet neogenesis.""" .

In recent years, there has been increasing interest in the development of new strategies to induce beta-cell regeneration and new islet formation in situ and a role for Reg proteins has been suggested. One such protein, islet neogenesis associated protein (INGAP), is a member of the Reg3 family of proteins and has been shown to induce islet neogenesis. Elucidation of the mechanisms and factors involved in the regulation of expression of INGAP and related proteins is, therefore, of great importance. Here, we report the establishment of the first in vitro tissue model of INGAP expression that consists of epithelial cystic structures derived from hamster pancreatic acinar tissue cultured in collagen matrix. The objective of this study was to characterize INGAP expression in this model and to investigate the role of pro-inflammatory cytokines and growth factors. Using quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR, we show that INGAP expression correlates with cyst formation and size suggesting the involvement of intra-luminal pressure associated with cyst growth. We also demonstrate for the first time that INGAP gene expression was significantly induced by treatment with interleukin (IL)-6 and further enhanced by a combination of IL-6 with dexamethazone and nicotinamide. Additionally, our data suggest that the effect of IL-6 on INGAP expression is mediated via the JAK/STAT3 signaling pathway.

Restoration of beta cell mass through pharmaceutically induced endogenous beta cell mass expansion may revolutionise diabetes therapy. However, it remains to be determined whether the induced beta cell mass expansion is under homeostatic regulation. METHODS: Beta cell mass expansion rates were derived from three separate studies of continuous stimulation of islet neogenesis, including the partial duct obstruction of euglycaemic Syrian hamsters, administration of a pentadecapeptide with the same amino acid sequence as residues 104-118 of islet neogenesis-associated protein (INGAP(104-118)) to euglycaemic Syrian hamsters, as well as to euglycaemic CD-1 mice. The incidence of islet neogenesis, average beta cell size, and beta cell replication and apoptotic rates were determined. RESULTS: Partial duct obstruction led to a approximately 2.5-fold increase in endocrine tissue at day 56 (p<0.05). From day 0 to day 7 the average rate of change of islet area was 12.7% per day, and this rate decreased to 5.3% per day from day 7 to day 42, and to 2.8% per day from day 42 to day 56.

INGAP(104-118) administration to adult CD-1 mice resulted in an approximately twofold increase in beta cell mass after 31 days (p=0.021).

It is a paracrine factor whcih appears to induce neogenesis (maturation or perhaps differentiation from precursor cells) of islet cells. Along the way, counterregulation of this action was also inferred, and at least one faactor involved (PDX1) also identified.

In this study, factors that regulate the expression of INGAP promoter activity are reported. To determine factors that regulate INGAP expression, we previously cloned the promoter region for INGAP. Analysis of the INGAP promoter suggested that candidate regulators of INGAP expression include the transcription factors PDX-1, NeuroD, PAN-1, STAT and AP-1. Using gene addition experiments in the 293 cell line the activity of these transcription factors on an INGAP-promoter construct linked to the beta-galactosidase reporter has been determined. Induction of AP-1 activity or STAT activity using PMA or LIF stimulation respectively, or direct expression of PAN-1 specifically up-regulates INGAP promoter activity. In contrast, co-expression of PDX-1 but not NeuroD inhibits activation of the INGAP-promoter driven by PAN-1, PMA or LIF stimulation.

SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: INGAP, a 175 amino acid pancreatic acinar cell protein, has been suggested to be implicated in beta-cell mass expansion. METHODS: In the first part of this study, normoglycemic hamsters were administered either 500 microg INGAP peptide (n = 30) or saline (n = 20) intraperitoneally daily and sacrificed after 10 or 30 days of treatment. Blood glucose and insulin levels were measured, and a histologic and morphometric analysis of the pancreas was performed to determine the effect of INGAP peptide on the endocrine pancreas. In the second part of the study, 6- to 8-week-old C57BL/6J mice (n = 8) were administered multiple low doses of the beta-cell toxin streptozotocin (STZ) inducing insulitis and hyperglycemia. The mice were then injected with INGAP peptide (n = 4) or saline (n = 4) for 39 days and sacrificed at 48 days. Two additional groups of diabetic mice were administered either a peptide composed of a scrambled sequence of amino acids from INGAP peptide (n = 5) or exendin-4 (n = 5), an incretin that has been associated with amelioration of hyperglycemia. RESULTS: Islet cell neogenesis was stimulated in INGAP-treated hamsters by 10 days. At 30 days, the foci of new endocrine cells had the appearance of mature islets. There was a 75% increase in islet number, with normal circulating levels of blood glucose and insulin. Administration of INGAP peptide to diabetic mice reversed the diabetic state in all animals, and this was associated with increased expression of PDX-1 in duct cells and islet cell neogenesis with a reduction of insulitis in the new islets. Diabetic mice treated with exendin-4 or a scrambled INGAP peptide did not revert from hyperglycemia. CONCLUSION: Because there is a deficiency of beta-cell mass in both type-1 and type-2 diabetes, INGAP peptide stimulation of fully functional neoislet differentiation may provide a novel approach for diabetes therapy.""" .

be mediated by a humoral mechanism because the changes induced by
partial obstruction were not observed in the non-operated parabiont.

involve paracrine and/or autocrine regulatory mechanisms.""" .

We analysed the clinical, morphological and immunohistological features to further clarify the aetiology and pathogenesis of this rare disease. PATIENTS: Ten consecutive patients with NIPHS (nine men and one woman, aged 29-78 years) were included in the study. Six of the 10 received a gradient-guided subtotal (70%) or distal (50%) pancreatectomy. In the remaining four patients, diazoxide treatment was initiated and the precise mechanism of its action was assessed by meal tests. RESULTS: All of the patients showed a combination of postprandial neuroglycopaenia, negative prolonged fasts (except one patient) and negative localization studies for insulinoma, but positive calcium stimulation tests and nesidioblastosis in the gradient-guided resected pancreas. Immunohistological studies of the resected pancreatic tissues revealed neither an increased rate of proliferation of beta-cells nor an abnormal synthesis and/or processing of either proinsulin or amylin. Evidence of overexpression of the two pancreatic differentiation factors, PDX-1 and Nkx-6.1, as well as the calcium sensing receptor (CaSR) was absent. Nevertheless, abnormal expression of islet neogenesis-associated protein (INGAP), a human cytokine expressed only in the presence of islet neogenesis, in ducts and/or islets, was identified in three of the five patients studied. All of the six patients who received a surgical operation were relieved of further neuroglycopaenic attacks, but one patient who received a subtotal pancreatectomy developed diabetes. In the remaining four patients who received diazoxide treatment, hypoglycaemic episodes were satisfactorily controlled with an attenuated response of beta-cell peptides to meal stimulation. CONCLUSIONS: Our results strengthen the existence of this unique clinical hypoglycaemic syndrome from beta-cell hyperfunction as well as the value of the selective arterial calcium stimulation test in its correct diagnosis and localization. The mechanisms underlying beta-cell hyperfunction and release of insulin to calcium, however, remain poorly characterized. Nevertheless, in a subset of patients with NIPHS, there exists some, as yet undefined, pancreatic humoral/paracrine factor(s) other than proinsulin, amylin, PDX-1, Nkx-6.1 and possibly glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) that are capable of inducing the INGAP gene and, if activated, will initiate ductal proliferation and islet neogenesis. As for the treatment, we recommend that diazoxide be tried first in each patient and, should it fail, a gradient-guided subtotal or distal pancreatectomy be attempted.""" ;

The addition of forskolin or dibutyryl cyclic AMP enhanced the effects of INGAP peptide on neurite outgrowth in dorsal root ganglia explant cultures. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of adenylate cyclase with SQ22,536 or of protein kinase A with H89 or KT5720 significantly reduced the neurite-promoting effects of INGAP peptide.

A scrambled 15 aminoacid peptide was used as control for the specificity of INGAP-PP effect. Cultured neonatal and adult islets released insulin in response to glucose (2.8-16.7 mM) in a dose-dependent manner, and to leucine and arginine (10 mM). In all cases, the response was greater in adult islets. INGAP-PP added to the culture medium significantly enhanced glucose- and aminoacid-induced insulin release in both adult and newborn rats; however, no changes were observed with the scrambled peptide. Similar results were obtained incubating freshly isolated adult rat islets with INGAP-PP. Whereas INGAP-PP did not induce significant changes in islet survival rate or proportion/number of islet cells, it increased significantly beta-cell size.

    :abstract """After many decades of relative therapeutic stagnation since the initial discovery of insulin, followed by some modifications on its structure and only having sulfonylureas and biguanides for many years, the last decade has seen a surge in new therapeutic options for the management of diabetes. The results of the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study and Kumamoto study indicate the need for aggressive glycemic control and the slow inexorable clinical deterioration associated with type 2 diabetes overtime. The propensity for weight gain and hypoglycemia are the two major limitations that subcutaneous insulin and sulfonylureas have been particularly prone to. The newer antidiabetic medications and those on the horizon attempt to address these limitations. GLP-1 agonists and the DPP-IV inhibitors exploit the innate incretin system to improve glycemia while promoting satiety and weight management. Like GLP-1 related compounds, pramlintide offers the potential to address postprandial hyperglucagonemia associated with type 2 diabetes only limited by the multiple injections and gastrointestinal side effects. The glitazars offer the hope ofa new approach to diabetes care addressing not just glycemia, but dyslipidemia and other components of the metabolic syndrome, though the side effect profile remains a major unknown. The INGAP peptide represents the holy grail of diabetes care as it offers the potential of a new paradigm: that of islet regeneration and potential for a cure. But at this stage, with no human data available, it remains highly speculative. Beyond these and other novel agents being developed to meet the challenge of the worldwide epidemic of diabetes, the central place of insulin in diabetes care cannot be forgotten. In view of this the continued efforts of improvement in insulin delivery, kinetics and action have spurred such innovations as the various inhaled insulins and new insulin analogues. There is cause for guarded optimism and excitement about the years ahead. There is reason to expect that despite the growing burden of diabetes worldwide, we will be better equipped to manage it and its comorbidities and prevent its onset and possibly even cure it.""" ;

Several sources call INGAP a "cytokine," but none actually indicate immune cell involement; they appear to be using it more generically as "paracrine factor." But there is the observation of stimulation by IL-6  and involvemet of STAT-3 ...

The implication then is that functioinal, healthy islets produce INGAP
to stimulate precursor differentiation or development, and PDX-1 (and perhaps other factors) represses it homeostatically to keep total populations at appropriate levels; ablation of islet cells, as in STZ, removes the former, whatever it may do to the latter.

Ironically, this may give an ADVANTAGE to transplantation of mature
islet cells (instead of ESCs as such), as the latter woiuld perhaps not secrete INGAP. INdeed, the comparisons of wrapped vs unwrapped pancreases MAY  mean that even these won't do it, but that INGAP will be required to coax them along. I suppose that  more primitive cells plus INGAP might be the best combination; hard to guess without knowing the metabolism better, or just doing it as an engineering project.

I suppose in a sense this is actually a lot less exciting on a THEORETICAL level, however important it might wind up being therapeutically, than I've been thinking as I pursued the chain of discovery: we know that precursor cells of various types require factors for their differentiation and as trophic factors from other cases.

It has been shown that pancreatic tissue is able to regenerate in several species of mammal after surgical insult. This tissue is also known to have the potential to maintain or increase its beta-cell mass in response to metabolic demands during pregnancy and obesity. Since deficiency in beta-cell mass is the hallmark of most forms of diabetes, it is worthwhile understanding pancreatic regeneration in the context of this disease. With this view in mind, this article aims to discuss the potential use in clinical strategies of knowledge that we obtained from studies carried out in animal models of diabetes. Approaches to achieve this goal involve the use of biomolecules, adult stem cells and gene therapy. Various molecules, such as glucagon-like peptide-1, beta-cellulin, nicotinamide, gastrin, epidermal growth factor-1 and thyroid hormone, play major roles in the initiation of endogenous islet regeneration in diabetes. The most accepted hypothesis is that these molecules stimulate islet precursor cells to undergo neogenesis or to induce replication of existing beta-cells, emphasizing the importance of pancreas-resident stem/progenitor cells in islet regeneration.

It's the process of discovery that's been exciting, and also the apparently paracrine nature of the signal and that it derives from normal cells.

Does support the idea that adding new cells will be "adding information to the system;" also, the PDX-1 finding shows the usual irritating Janus-facedness of metabolism: I see that "Embryologically, the PDX1 homeodomain protein is critical for the initiation of all pancreatic lineages, however, the later differentiation of the endocrine pancreas is uniquely dependent upon high PDX1 expression, whereas PDX1 is downregulated in the ductal and acinar cell lineages." -- the latter of which also being the main identified INGAP secretor.""" .

Thus inhibiting translation may extend lifespan by shifting cells to physiological states that favor maintenance and repair. Interestingly, different types of translation inhibition lead to one of two mutually exclusive outputs, one that increases lifespan and stress resistance through the transcription factor DAF-16/FOXO, and one that increases lifespan and stress resistance independently of DAF-16. Our findings link TOR, but not sir-2.1, to the longevity response induced by dietary restriction (DR) in C. elegans, and they suggest that neither TOR inhibition nor DR extends lifespan simply by reducing protein synthesis.""" ;

    :abstract """Regulation of protein synthesis is critical for cell growth and maintenance. Ageing in many organisms, including humans, is accompanied by marked alterations in both general and specific protein synthesis. Whether these alterations are simply a corollary of the ageing process or have a causative role in senescent decline remains unclear. An array of protein factors facilitates the tight control of messenger RNA translation initiation. The eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), which binds the 7-monomethyl guanosine cap at the 5' end of all nuclear mRNAs, is a principal regulator of protein synthesis. Here we show that loss of a specific eIF4E isoform (IFE-2) that functions in somatic tissues reduces global protein synthesis, protects from oxidative stress and extends lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans. Lifespan extension is independent of the forkhead transcription factor DAF-16, which mediates the effects of the insulin-like signalling pathway on ageing. Furthermore, IFE-2 deficiency further extends the lifespan of long-lived age and daf nematode mutants. Similarly, lack of IFE-2 enhances the long-lived phenotype of clk and dietary-restricted eat mutant animals. Knockdown of target of rapamycin (TOR), a phosphatidylinositol kinase-related kinase that controls protein synthesis in response to nutrient cues, further increases the longevity of ife-2 mutants. Thus, signalling via eIF4E in the soma is a newly discovered pathway influencing ageing in C. elegans.""" ;

We report the development of a multiplex three-primer PCR assay that is capable of absolute quantitation of wild-type and deleted mtDNA simultaneously. Molecular beacons were designed to hybridize with either type of mtDNA molecule, allowing real-time detection during PCR amplification. The assay is specific and can detect down to six copies of mtDNA, making it suitable for single-cell analyses. The relative standard deviation in the threshold cycle number is approximately 0.6%. Heteroplasmy was quantitated in individual cytoplasmic hybrid cells (cybrids), containing a large mtDNA deletion, and bulk cell samples. Individual cybrid cells contained 100-2600 copies of wild-type mtDNA and 950-4700 copies of deleted mtDNA, and the percentage of heteroplasmy ranged from 43+/-16 to 95+/-16%. The average amount of total mtDNA was 3800+/-1600 copies/cybrid cell, and the average percentage of heteroplasmy correlated well with the bulk cell sample. The single-cell analysis also revealed that heteroplasmy in individual cells is highly heterogeneous.

That seems a LITTLE ambitious -- I was thinking I could average close to 2 including the fact that there are pretty reliable null results (esp since that largely just means a pileup on the following Monday or Tuesday) -- but not totally out of touch with my actal capacities.

Well, it certainly wasn't clear  on the versioin of the "Too Few Cells" page of your website that I edited, which presumably was intended to represent your current thinking: it looked as if you were proposing exercise, growth factors, and stem cells as complementary optionss & alternatives, not stem cells as the key SENS intervention with the others as adjuncts. To a certain extent it still does even now -- I would incline not to put up the recordings on exercise at all. Your actual view is more like what I'd expect it to be and what is most consistent with SENS logic and the data as I read 'em, and could probably be explicated yet further.

A generally accepted hypothesis has been that long-lasting activity-dependent changes in the efficacy of synaptic transmission in the mammalian brain are considered to be of fundamental importance for the storage of information.

    :abstract """In Corynebacterium diphtheriae, diphtheria toxin is encoded by the tox gene of some temperate corynephages such as beta. beta-like corynephages are capable of inserting into the C. diphtheriae chromosome at two specific sites, attB1 and attB2. Transcription of the phage-encoded tox gene, and many chromosomally encoded genes, is regulated by the DtxR protein in response to Fe(2+) levels. Characterizing DtxR-dependent gene regulation is pivotal in understanding diphtheria pathogenesis and mechanisms of iron-dependent gene expression; although this has been hampered by a lack of molecular genetic tools in C. diphtheriae and related Coryneform species. To expand the systems for genetic manipulation of C. diphtheriae, we constructed plasmid vectors capable of integrating into the chromosome. These plasmids contain the beta-encoded attP site and the DIP0182 integrase gene of C. diphtheriae NCTC13129. When these vectors were delivered to the cytoplasm of non-lysogenic C. diphtheriae, they integrated into either the attB1 or attB2 sites with comparable frequency. Lysogens were also transformed with these vectors, by virtue of the second attB site. An integrated vector carrying an intact dtxR gene complemented the mutant phenotypes of a C. diphtheriae DeltadtxR strain. Additionally, strains of beta-susceptible C. ulcerans, and C. glutamicum, a species non-permissive for beta, were each transformed with these vectors. This work significantly extends the tools available for targeted transformation of both pathogenic and non-pathogenic Corynebacterium species.""" ;

    dc:title "Mitochondrial function: use it or lose it" ;
    :excerpt """The basis of the apparent mitochondrial dysfunction associated with insulin resistance is also yet to be identified. Impairments in muscle oxidative capacity could potentially arise from a defect in mitochondrial function and/or a reduction in the number of mitochondria. In this issue of Diabetologia, Boushel et al. [20] provide direct evidence to refute the former premise by demonstrating that mitochondrial function is normal in the skeletal muscle of patients with type 2 diabetes.

The major finding ... was that when O2 flux was normalised for markers of mitochondrial content ..., oxidative phosphorylation and electron transport capacity in muscle extracts obtained from patients with type 2 diabetes were not different from those observed in muscle of age-matched healthy control subjects. In other words, the authors found no evidence for a decrease in the quality of the mitochondria in skeletal muscle from type 2 diabetic subjects. This is an important observation, but one that seems incongruous with reports from several other laboratories describing mitochondrial dysfunction in skeletal muscle from patients with type 2 diabetes [6, 12, 15–17]. However, we suggest that the findings from Boushel et al. [20] and others are not incongruent ... mitochondrial respiration was indeed lower ... but this was due to a reduction in muscle oxidative capacity (i.e. the number of mitochondria) rather than mitochondrial function itself....

... the missing link connecting muscle mitochondrial function with metabolic disease risk factors is the level of habitual contractile activity.  Chronic inactivity (or disuse) results in a decrease in mitochondrial number [21], aberrant lipid handling [2] and an impaired health profile [22]. In contrast, chronic activity (exercise training) results in marked mitochondrial biogenesis [21], increased lipid oxidation and turnover [23], and an improved health status [22]. It therefore follows that interventions that result in either a decrease or increase in mitochondrial content should cause reciprocal changes in health/disease outcomes. Several lines of evidence suggest that this is indeed the case.""" .

We now report that exposure of transgenic mice to an "enriched environment" results in pronounced reductions in cerebral Abeta levels and amyloid deposits, compared to animals raised under "standard housing" conditions. The enzymatic activity of an Abeta-degrading endopeptidase, neprilysin, is elevated in the brains of "enriched" mice and inversely correlated with amyloid burden. Moreover, DNA microarray analysis revealed selective upregulation in levels of transcripts encoded by genes associated with learning and memory, vasculogenesis, neurogenesis, cell survival pathways, Abeta sequestration, and prostaglandin synthesis. These studies provide evidence that environmental enrichment leads to reductions in steady-state levels of cerebral Abeta peptides and amyloid deposition and selective upregulation in levels of specific transcripts in brains of transgenic mice.""" ;

Recent epidemiological studies, however, suggest that lifestyle changes may slow the onset/progression of AD. Here we have used TgCRND8 mice to examine directly the interaction between exercise and the AD cascade. Five months of voluntary exercise resulted in a decrease in extracellular amyloid-beta (Abeta) plaques in the frontal cortex (38%; p = 0.018), the cortex at the level of the hippocampus (53%; p = 0.0003), and the hippocampus (40%; p = 0.06). This was associated with decreased cortical Abeta1-40 (35%; p = 0.005) and Abeta1-42 (22%; p = 0.04) (ELISA). The mechanism appears to be mediated by a change in the processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) after short-term exercise, because 1 month of activity decreased the proteolytic fragments of APP [for alpha-C-terminal fragment (alpha-CTF), 54% and p = 0.04; for beta-CTF, 35% and p = 0.03]. This effect was independent of mRNA/protein changes in neprilysin and insulin-degrading enzyme and, instead, may involve neuronal metabolism changes that are known to affect APP processing and to be regulated by exercise. Long-term exercise also enhanced the rate of learning of TgCRND8 animals in the Morris water maze, with significant (p < 0.02) reductions in escape latencies over the first 3 (of 6) trial days.

    :abstract """Neuronal cell death, neurofibrillary tangles, and amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) deposition depict Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology, but neuronal loss correlates best with dementia. We have shown that increased production of Abeta is a consequence of neuronal apoptosis, suggesting that apoptosis activates proteases involved in amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing. Here, we investigate key effectors of cell death, caspases, in human neuronal apoptosis and APP processing. We find that caspase-6 is activated and responsible for neuronal apoptosis by serum deprivation. Caspase-6 activity precedes the time of commitment to neuronal apoptosis by 10 h, indicating possible activity without subsequent apoptosis. Inhibition of caspase-6 activity prevents serum deprivation-mediated increase of Abeta. Caspase-6 directly cleaves APP at the C terminus and generates a C-terminal fragment of 3 kDa (Capp3) and an Abeta-containing 6.5-kDa fragment, Capp6.5, that increases in serum-deprived neurons. A pulse-chase experiment reveals a precursor-product relationship between Capp6.5, intracellular Abeta, and secreted Abeta, indicating a potential alternate amyloidogenic pathway. Caspase-6 proenzyme is present in adult human brain tissue, and the p10 active caspase-6 fragment is detected in AD brain tissue. These results indicate a possible alternate pathway for APP amyloidogenic processing in human neurons and a potential implication for this pathway in the neuronal demise of AD.""" ;
