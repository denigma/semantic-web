# Extends the global Mercury object with various modules.
#
# In general it's expected that you use the methods provided on the Mercury namespace, and don't call through to the
# modules directly.
#
# A good example of this is the Mercury.I18n module. It's recommended that you use Mercury.t and not Mercury.I18n.t,
# or similarly with Mercury.Logger -- use Mercury.log (or this.log in models and views etc.) instead of
# Mercury.Logger.log as the context may not be the same.

  # and if that doesn't suit your needs, feel free to instantiate the desired interface yourself.

  # Provides global way to load snippets and other data back into Mercury.
  #
  # This allows you to load snippet options back into snippets/the regions they're in, as well as providing an API to
  # load other data. Pass it the JSON hash that was saved and it should be able to handle the rest.
  #
  @load = (json) ->

  # Provides global method to load snippets and other data back into Mercury via Ajax.
  #
  # This allows you to create a server response with the data for the current page being edited.
  #
  @loadUrl = (url) ->

  #

  # This is because it's impossible to mock location.assign etc. and allows for better testing. Note: untestable.
  #
  @redirect = (url) ->

  # Add global configuration methods.
  #
  # Mercury.configure
  # Creates or updates configuration values. Accepts a path (eg. 'localization:preferred') and a value to be set.
  #
  # Mercury.config
  # Get a configuration value by providing a path (much like the setter).

  # Add exernal interface for common api actions.
  #
  # This adds commonly used methods to the global Mercury object. You can call these methods instead of triggering the
  # event -- this is provided as a convenience. The following methods will be on the global object.
  #
  # focus         - restores focus to mercury, which will focus the active region
  # blur          - blur mercury, which will give up focus and blur the region
  # save          - make the save ajax request
  # initialize    - lets mercury know that it can initialize
  # reinitialize  - tells mercury to go find any new regions
  # toggle        - toggles the interface
  # show          - shows the interface if it's hidden
  # hide          - hides the interface if it's visible
  #

  # Add global event handling/triggering.
  #
  # The event engine generally mimics jQuery style of binding and unbinding.
  #
  # Mercury.on
  # Binds to a global event. Not every event is global, but many are piped through globally so you can bind to them.
  #
  # Mercury.one
  # Same as Mercury.on, but will be removed after the first time the event is triggered.
  #
  # Mercury.trigger
  # Trigger a global event.
  #
  # Mercury.off
  # Stop observing a given global event.
  #

  # Add global translation.
  #
  # Mercury.t
  # Translate a given string with simple printf-like handling.
  #
  @Module.extend.call(@, @I18n)

  # Add global logger.
  #
  # Mercury.log
  # Logs the provided information using console.log if available.
  #
  # Mercury.notify
  # Logs a given message using console.error (and console.trace) if available, otherwise an exception is thrown.
  #
  @Module.extend.call(@, @Logger)

  # Add global plugin registration.
  #
  # This provides the means to register your plugins dynamically, as well as to get them easily.
  #
  # Mercury.registerPlugin
  # Define a plugin and register it so it can be configured and used.
  #
  # Mercury.getPlugin
  # Allows getting a plugin by name.
  #
  @Module.extend.call(@, @Plugin)

  # Add global snippet registration.
  #
  # This provides the means to register your snippets dynamically (in the same way as plugins), as well as to get them
  # easily.
  #
  # Mercury.registerSnippet
  # Define a snippet and register it so it can be configured and used.
  #
  # Mercury.getSnippet
  # Allows getting a snippet by name.
  #
  @Module.extend.call(@, @Snippet)

  # Do some detection.

  # complex aspects aren't something that you can detect for (eg. drag and drop event propagation).
