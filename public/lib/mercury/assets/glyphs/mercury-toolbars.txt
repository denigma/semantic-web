The toolbar icons (bold, italics, etc.) are in the `mercury-toolbars` font,
which was built using fontstruct.com (http://fontstruct.com/).

The original font (http://fontstruct.com/fontstructions/show/797530) can be
cloned and edited as needed. Fontstruct is used for this font because it allows
for small pixel fonts but also allows for more advanced shapes that scale nicely.
